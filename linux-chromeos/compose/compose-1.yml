#
#   * The file name depends on the location and the installation method (A, B or C);
#     in the $HOME/ directory, this is a hidden file named XCompose: ".XCompose";
#     inside the X11/ subdirectory in /usr/share/, this file is named only "Compose",
#     because the context is clear and the file names do not need to be any more specific.
#  ** In Unicode CLDR, this platform is labeled ChromeOS, and it is explained that
#     in the CLDR, the Linux OS is supported alongside ChromeOS, or through ChromeOS.
#
#               Installation: 1. Set the input method to XIM, because other input methods may
#                                not support multi-character output, including composed letters
#                                required for Unicode conformant output on dead keys; with the
#                                input method set to none, this XCompose file is not compiled.
#
#                                The following command activates the X Window Input Method:
#
#                                    im-config -n xim
#
#                                The currently active input method displays on line 2 after:
#
#                                    im-config -m
#
#                                Setting the input method to XIM to begin with is essential,
#                                because some Linux distros may not ship XIM as the default.
#
#                             2. Make sure to be using the full-length file XCompose.yml.
#
#                             3. Proceed following method A, B or C:
#
#                                CAUTION: If the environment variable $XCOMPOSEFILE is set,
#                                         its value is used as the path of the XCompose file.
#                                         In case of success, other XCompose files are not
#                                         compiled unless included as documented below.
#
#                                A. System level:
#                                   1. Back up the XCompose file at the path mapped onto the
#                                      locale in /usr/share/X11/locale/compose.dir; for fr_FR:
#                                      /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#                                   2. Append Compose.yml to the original XCompose file.
#                                      Prepending instead of appending breaks U1E7A and U1E7B,
#                                      that need to override U01D5 and U01D6 as defined in
#                                      en_US.UTF-8/Compose. The same holds true for "V́", "v́"
#                                      overriding en_US.UTF-8/Compose for U01D7 and U01D8.
#
#                                B. User level, with .XCompose in the $HOME/ directory:
#                                   1. Back up the file $HOME/.XCompose.
#                                   2. Append Compose.yml to $HOME/.XCompose.
#
#                                C. User level, without .XCompose in the $HOME/ directory:
#                                   1. Copy Compose.yml to $HOME/.XCompose.
#                                   2. For maximum backward compatibility, uncomment this
#                                      instruction, where "%L" expands to the default XCompose
#                                      file path of the current locale, that for fr_FR is
#                                      /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#
#                                          include "%L"
#
#                                   This is required for using non-Latin keyboard layouts
#                                   with dead keys as supported in en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#                                   Any specific XCompose file can be included by its path,
#                                   where "%S" expands to /usr/share/X11/locale:
#
#                                          include "%S/en_US.UTF-8/Compose"
#
#                             The changes take effect in any application after reopening it,
#                             or after opening a new session if XIM needs to be activated.
#
#             Uninstallation: A, B: Restore the previously backed-up original XCompose file.
#                             C:    Delete or rename the added file $HOME/.XCompose.

#                               A combination of underengineering and lack of consultancy due
#                               to impiety triggered design mistakes, incrementally fixed in
#                               versions 2..5 as they came up. In the first place the level-3
#                               ASCII map was inadequate by not making room for the euro sign
#                               until v2.0 when it ultimately became practical and respectful
#                               thanks to God helping and advising about the layout details.
#                               The superscripts were at the wrong level, and modifiers for
#                               titlecase polygrams "Cʼh" and "Nᵒ " were unintuitive, due to
#                               not seeking advice from God until ultimately v3.0 came up. A
#                               wrong modifier (AltFr instead of Shift) used for spaced-out
#                               punctuation, with a semblance of logic but without usability,
#                               was due to never asking God which modifier is the correct one
#                               for spaced-out punctuation, until v4.0. And duplicate comma,
#                               duplicate period in ASCII mode on the graphic numpad’s keys
#                               B07 and B08 were due to a desperate attempt to stay backwards
#                               compatible as far as possible, until God helped to notice the
#                               valuable UX improvement due to moving Left Shift closer as of
#                               B07..B10 in ASCII mode compared to French mode, hence v5.0.
#                               Bottomline: Development was delayed since 2016 when a workable
#                               solution was overdue, until 2025 when NF Z71-300 released in
#                               2019-04 was under revision (with a deadline on 2024-07-31),
#                               due to only reluctantly praying God for help and advice, rather
#                               than following the straightforward way roadmapped in the Bible.

### Multicharacter strings for live keys
#
#   Dead key handling XCompose has the ability to output more than one single
#   code unit, outperforming the misdesigned Windows Text Services Framework,
#   that can do so by live keys only, and is limited to 16 UTF-16 code units,
#   and even to only 4 code units on Shift + Ctrl + Alt (modifier byte 0x07),
#   as opposed to XCompose, that does not impose any upper limit on the result
#   string length, and also handles multicharacter output on single live key
#   press.
#   https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.xhtml
#   https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.html
#   https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/man5/Compose.5.html
#   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ComposeKey#Compose_key
#   https://wiki.debian.org/XCompose
#   https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/libx11-doc/XCompose.3.en.html
#
#   However, for the multicharacter feature to be effective and actually work,
#   activating the X Window Input Method, XIM for short, is mandatory.
#   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xkeyboard-config/+bug/1584314/comments/6
#   http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man8/im-config.8.html
#   https://askubuntu.com/questions/129680/how-can-i-make-ibus-not-ignore-xcompose
#
#   In XCompose, a single keysym hapax is processed for direct output, whereas
#   a keysym followed by another keysym at least once is handled as a dead key
#   throughout, and its singleton output is discarded. Thus, the system “eats”
#   the dead key press if the input sequence is undefined.
#
#   Definition format in XCompose files:
#
#       * Single character output may be defined like in allocation tables,
#         but this format is reportedly not interoperable across XKB.
#       * Strings must be defined as literals delimited by double quotes.
#         This is the interoperable format for single character output, too.
#
#   Both formats may be used concurrently. Therefore, single character output
#   is defined both as a string, which is mandatory, and as a keysym providing
#   a redundant convenience. However, on the result side, the preferred keysyms
#   are Unicode scalars rather than X11 keysyms, that have limited coverage and
#   are not directly interoperable.
#
#   Definition format in allocation tables (Symbols directory):
#   Single character output in any UCS plane may be defined in several formats:
#
#       * Uxxxx[x[x]] hexadecimal
#       * U00xxxxxx hexadecimal
#       * 0x01xxxxxx hexadecimal
#
#   The specified format "\0x123A" does not seem to work.
#   https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.html
#
#   These layouts make extensive use of keysyms added as documented in
#   keysymdef.h:148.
#   /usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h
#   https://fossies.org/linux/tk/xlib/X11/keysymdef.h
#
#   The scheme using Private Use characters instead of missing dead keysyms is
#   found on FDO as well as on GNOME.
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19506
#   https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=537457#c7
#
#   Unicode Private Use areas are managed by CSUR and UCSUR.

#   http://www.kreativekorp.com/ucsur/
#
#
# # Notes about syntax and terms
#
#   Characters and dead keys are referred to by their X11 keysyms as defined in
#   keysymdef.h.
#   https://fossies.org/linux/tk/xlib/X11/keysymdef.h
#
#   For external documentation, generic X11 keysyms for Unicode characters need
#   to be converted to Unicode code points by adding the plus sign next to the
#   leading "U".
#   See # # Notes about documentation
#
#   For development, maintenance and reference, UnicodeData.txt is formatted by
#   the script format-UnicodeData-txt.pl.

#   https://github.com/dispoclavier/nouvel-azerty/blob/main/linux-chromeos/outils/format-UnicodeData-txt.pl
#
#   The URL scheme used for the Unicode Code Charts is consistent with tbe
#   omission of the plus sign in X11 keysyms.

#
#
#   End of line comments
#
#   All lines containing a compose sequence must also contain a comment before
#   the end of line, for compatibility with non-conformant compilers expecting
#   compose sequences to extend until a numbersign. A lack of numbersign is an
#   error for these compilers, and the sequence is discarded.
#
#   According to the spec, section "File Format", comments are optional.

#   Section headings have three leading hashes for visibility. Then come a set
#   of subsection levels with or without special markup depending on importance
#   and functionality as follows.
#
#   Parsing the multikey section, the generate-multikey-tables.pl script needs
#   a caret between the leading hashes of a subsection heading to start a new
#   subsection partial table file.
#   See # # Notes about documentation
#
#   Parsing the deadkey section, the generate-deadkey-tables.pl script needs
#   an asterisk between the leading hashes of a subsection heading to start a
#   new subsection partial table file.
#   See # # Notes about documentation
#
#   Annotations feature subsection headings marked up by two leading hashes,
#   each one followed by a space, and subsection headings without extra markup
#   besides the start-of-line hash followed by three spaces for a usual margin.
#
#
#   Cross-references
#
#   Maintenance is complicated by the potential use of every heading, and even
#   several paragraph starts, in cross references featuring the instance from
#   start of line to end of line, or end of keyword, preceded by "#   See ".
#
#
#   Multikey sequence notation
#
#   The broken bar "¦" U00A6 is repurposed as multikey symbol.
#   See # # Symbols for multikey
#
#   For readability, inline literal multikey sequences are bracketed with
#   French-style (no-break thin) space padded double angle quotation marks,
#   because quotedbl, grave, period, comma and other ASCII symbols likely to
#   occur next to multikey sequences, may also be part of multikey seqences.
#   The padding space is NBTSP for convenience and consistency. By contrast,
#   the plus sign after modifier key notations is not NBTSP-padded (although
#   it normally should be), for maintainability/searchability, and assuming
#   that NBTSP would be pointless with fixed-width fonts and hard line breaks.
#
#
#   Spelling of "multikey"
#
#   The word "multikey" is not hyphenated. “Multi words are not hyphenated
#   unless such spelling makes for awkward reading.”

# # Breton trigraph
#
#   Breton using "c" only as initial of the two polygraphs "cʼh" and "ch" is
#   prone to being supported by a keyboard layout featuring these as all-in-one
#   strings in lowercase, titlecase (Shift) and uppercase (Caps Lock).
#
#   The Brezhoneg keyboard layout from An drouizig has its key D01 featuring
#   the Breton trigraph.

#
#   The reason why supporting the Breton trigraph as an all-in-one string makes
#   much sense is the required medial letter apostrophe "ʼ" U02BC. Alongside,
#   Breton requires the usual punctuation apostrophe "’" U2019.
#
#   In 2011, James Cloos reported, and Denis Jacquerye confirmed citing CLDR,
#   that the apostrophe in the Breton trigraph is the letter apostrophe U02BC.

#
#   The reason why the Breton trigraph is regularly composed of a "c" and an
#   "h" separated by a letter apostrophe U02BC, not a punctuation apostrophe
#   U2019, is to prevent word boundaries around the apostrophe.
#
#   Consistently, the basic set of exemplar characters for Breton is (at least
#   since CLDR version 21 (2012-02-10)):

#
#   The variants for Breton and French "kbbrFRs" and "kbbrFRsr" have the Breton
#   trigraph at Base level and Shift level of key E01. All variants, including

#   (Shift +) AltGr + AltFr + A, key D01 as on the CʼHWERTY keyboard layout. On

#   apostrophe is in group 1 of apostrophe and rightsinglequotemark.

# # Punctuation spacing for French, regular with U202F NBTSP
#
#   French usage of no-break thin space
#
#   This is regular typesetting at Imprimerie nationale except for colon and
#   quotation marks, although the latter are typeset with narrow space in the
#   Imprimerie nationale style guide _Lexique des règles typographiques en
#   usage à l’Imprimerie nationale_, Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 2002; only
#   the rule on page 149 differs.
#
#   Philippe Verdy reported on the Unicode Public mailing list that the most
#   straightforward Unicode character representing this no-break thin space is
#   NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE U+202F.
#   https://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2015-m06/0220.html
#
#   In mainstream high-quality publishing, referred to as new school, no-break
#   thin space is used throughout.
#   https://forums.macg.co/threads/typo-caracteres-capitales-accentues.25739/page-5#post-3151119
#
#   Imprimerie nationale, France does not formally categorize punctuation marks
#   into big punctuation and small punctuation or double punctuation and simple
#   punctuation, nor does it support all punctuation marks: The em dash and the
#   en dash are merged, and the single angle quotation marks U2039 and U203A go
#   unmentioned. Part of the punctuation is spaced out using either of:
#
#       * No-break justifying space, behaving like Unicode’s NBSP U00A0;
#       * No-break thin space, behaving like Unicode’s NBTSP U202F.
#
#   Which one exactly depends on the punctuation mark and on whether we want to
#   know the rules in use at Imprimerie nationale, or if it is about the usage.
#   The semicolon and the question and exclamation marks are typeset exactly as
#   stated in the style guide with a no-break thin space. The colon too, with a
#   no-break justifying space. The double angle quotation marks are ruled like
#   colon but typeset like semicolon.
#
#   The no-break thin space seems to be the “espace fine insécable” mentioned
#   in the Unicode Standard, a no-break clone of Unicode’s thin space TSP U2009
#   designed to be no-break but ultimately released as breaking.
#
#
#   No-break thin space in the Unicode Standard
#
#   Indeed, U202F NNBSP, also known as no-break thin space, is a character that
#   despite being encoded for Mongolian with specific handling intended, was
#   readily adopted for use in French, Philippe Verdy reported, to that
#   extent that it was ultimately a special requirement for Mongolian that
#   brought the long-missing no-break thin space into the UCS, in the block
#   that it actually belongs to, and where it had been available since the
#   beginning if there had been no desire to keep the working-as-intended U2009
#   proprietary.
#   https://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2019-m01/0146.html
#
#   That is the hidden — almost occult — fact where stances like “The NNBSP can
#   be used to represent the narrow space occurring around punctuation
#   characters in French typography, which is called an ‘espace fine
#   insécable.’” (TUS) and “When NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE occurs in French text,
#   it should be interpreted as an ‘espace fine insécable’.” (UAX #14) are
#   stemming from. The underlying meaning is like: “The no-break thin space is
#   usually a vendor-specific layout control in DTP applications; it’s also
#   available via a TeX command. However, if you are interested in an
#   interoperable representation, here’s a Unicode character you can use
#   instead.”
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/core-spec/chapter-6/#G26915
#   https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-51.html#NNBSPdoc
#
#   Unicode was supposed to encode SI/BIPM number typesetting as well as French
#   punctuation typesetting, and for that purpose encoded THIN SPACE along with
#   other typographic space characters in the range U2000..U200A. Accordingly,
#   the line breaking property was set to no-break for all spaces starting with
#   U2002, after the two widest spaces in a breaking variant: U2000, U2001, as
#   opposed to U2002, U2003, consistently with TeX, where \qquad and \quad are
#   breaking, while \emspace, \enspace and \thinspace are no-break. Although
#   this difference does not seem to be documented, it was obviously well known
#   and fostered the original typographical space range design.
#   https://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/knuth/dist/tex/texbook.tex
#   https://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/Archives-Old/UML023/0536.html
#
#   But that design goal was ultimately compromised. To cover up the vandalism,
#   U2007 FIGURE SPACE was left no-break with the allegation that this space is
#   used “in” numbers, and even stating that it is digit-wide, defeating the
#   point in advertising U2007 for use as a group separator. Indeed, U2007 was
#   encoded as the tabular space, to be used before numbers when typesetting
#   tables the old way, alongside indentation by the width of a decimal dot or
#   comma, using U2008 PUNCTUATION SPACE.
#   https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-51.html
#
#       This is the preferred space to use in numbers. It has the same width as
#       a digit and keeps the number together for the purpose of line breaking.

#
#      The Unicode Standard includes several different space characters.
#      It is acceptable to use THIN SPACE, and then use a higher-level protocol,
#      a word joiner, or tailored line-breaking to prevent line-breaking.
#      Alternatively, NNBSP can be used to force no-break behavior.
#
#   However, higher level protocols and tailoring are inacceptable options when
#   considered for the purpose of digitally representing natural languages, the
#   more as the Unicode Standard specifies that it encodes plain text.

#   In the release note, section Detailed Data Changes:

#
#      The French locale now uses narrow no-break space U+202F in several
#      places: as the numeric grouping separator, in many short unit patterns,
#      and in the locale display name patterns. It also changed normal space to
#      no-break space U+00A0 in the wide unit patterns.
#
#   In the release note, section Migration:
#   https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-34#h.fm1q7yof3rxz_l
#
#      French grouping separator changed from no-break space U+00A0 to

#   Venetian got its CLDR coverage level raised in 2023, adding the decimal

# # Justifying no-break spaces
#
#   NO-BREAK SPACE U00A0 is tailored as fixed-width in word processors other
#   than Microsoft Word 2013, because it is misused for punctuation spacing in
#   lieu of U202F NBTSP, so that it raises issues in Polish, Russian and other
#   locales requiring no-break space as interword space, and thus requiring the
#   no-break space to be justifying as defined. This tailoring without settings
#   for NBSP justification and for the space used in French punctuation spacing
#   and without even locale sensitivity results in an abuse that makes sense as
#   part of the downgrading policy intended to limit word processors’ usability
#   for the interoperable representation of the world’s languages.

<UEF6F> : " ﻿" # With ZERO-WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE UFEFF [2]
#
#   [2] UFEFF is the byte order mark, and its use as ZWNBSP is obsoleted but
#       may still be supported, as it has 10 years of precedence in that role.
#
#
# # Punctuation spacing for French, legacy
#
#   These legacy fallbacks are limited to Latin-1/Latin-9 and use U00A0 NBSP.
#
#   This is regular with colon and quotation marks according to the style guide
#   of the French national printing house _Lexique des règles typographiques en
#   usage à l’Imprimerie nationale_, 2002, table page 149.
#
#   However, in this manual’s last edition in its 2017 reprint, angle quotation
#   marks are typeset with a narrow space, not a word space.
#
#   Once some “dysfunctional” keyboard layout variants supported some of these.
#   Now none of these are supported anymore.

# # Punctuation spacing for French using U2009 TSP, UFEFF ZWNBSP
#
#   This is a workaround for an acceptable fallback, given in most fonts NBTSP
#   has the same width as THIN SPACE, and THIN SPACE has line breaking class BA
#   (break after). UFEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE is the BYTE ORDER MARK, and
#   using it as a line break preventer is only a legacy workaround in case the
#   recommended, more recent U2060 WORD JOINER (Unicode 3.2, 2002) is not yet
#   supported. Hence the indefinite “a word joiner” in L2/19-286, section 20.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19286-script-recs.pdf#page=14
#
#   This fallback works everywhere U2009 THIN SPACE and UFEFF ZERO WIDTH
#   NO-BREAK SPACE are supported.
#
#   The Draw Spaces extension for Gedit consistently represents THIN SPACE like
#   normal SPACE, given that U2009 THIN SPACE is breaking.
#
#   These spaces are U2009 THIN SPACE followed by UFEFF ZWNBSP.

### Multikey sequences
#
#   In this file, the reference for XCompose sequences is en_US.UTF-8/Compose,
#   as it is used — and has been designed — in France.
#
#   The maximum number of keysyms is nine. Any longer sequences are going to be
#   ignored by the compiler.
#
#   Anyway, brevity is key, to that extent that non-critical elements are cut
#   off, resulting in truncated sequences that may be counter-intuitive but are
#   better for a streamlined user experience.
#   See #^# Western Zodiacal Signs
#   See # # Design of math sequences
#   See #   Streamlining

#   This file is also the source code for HTML table partials, such as those by

#   documenting multikey sequences, and those by generate-deadkey-tables.pl
#   documenting all other dead keys including the group dead key that activates
#   the 12 letter groups and the 12 symbol groups.

#   Polytonic Greek, however, is not documented in tables, as it is supported
#   mainly to meet eventual user expectations, and documenting it would be like
#   somewhat overkill.

#   The generate-multikey-tables.pl script, processing the multikey section,
#   expects a caret between the leading hashes of a subsection heading to start
#   an HTML table partial file, while in the dead key division, another script,
#   generate-deadkey-tables.pl, expects an asterisk between the hashes in the
#   same position. The dead key tables are numbered, while the multikey tables
#   are not, since their number is not finite. Adding a new file start heading
#   does not alter existing file names. However, each of these headings is used
#   to make a file name, and they are expected to be unique.

#^# Legacy ordinal indicators
#
#   The two Latin-1 ordinal indicators "ª" U00AA FEMININE ORDINAL INDICATOR and
#   "º" U00BA MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR are legacy characters, superseded by
#   the preformatted superscript small letters to be used as ordinal indicators
#   in Italian, Portuguese and Spanish as of "ᵃ" U1D43, "ᵒ" U1D52 and "ˢ" U02E2
#   that allows to support plural forms, as opposed to the legacy characters
#   designed to support singular only, as the most frequent use case, due to
#   scarcity of code points in 8-bit charsets.
#
#   Consistently, French ordinal indicators are preformatted superscripts, too:
#   "ᵈ" U1D48, "ᵉ" U1D49, "ʳ" U02B3, "ˢ" U02E2.
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/2ebe44fd537132620f61830ada804fb7abe1ec6b/common/main/fr.xml#L1546
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/main/fr.xml#L1546
#
#   All preformatted letters benefit from multikey support thanks to multikey
#   equivalents, for instance by <Multi_key><asciicircum><[the letter]>.
#   See #*# SUPERSCRIPT
#   See # # Multikey equivalents
#
#   The two legacy ordinal indicators are supported with alphabetic mnemonics
#   in group 12 of "^" on key A, and in group 12 of "}" on key O.
#   See # # D01 asciicircum
#   See # # D09 braceright
#
#   The following intuitive, case insensitive, underscore-terminated multikey
#   sequences add to this support in the symbol groups. Underscore termination
#   is consistent with "№" U2116 NUMERO SIGN in the next section. Many fonts
#   give the legacy ordinal indicators a line below, that is not preferred in
#   French and makes "º" U00BA unfit for use in the abbreviation for "numéro".

#
#^# Abbreviations, Units and Legal Symbols
#
#   A design goal is sideways compatibility with en_US.UTF-8/Compose as used in
#   France. One example is the pilcrow sign "¶" U00B6 by « ¦p! » and « ¦P! ».
#
#   Sequences for "©" U00A9 and "®" U00AE made out of letters only with an "O"
#   or an "o" are based on en_US.UTF-8/Compose, where "℗" U2117 is missing, as
#   ASCII fallback sequences « ¦(C) » and « ¦(R) », probably because the latter
#   would conflict with "Ȓ" U0212. To mitigate these gaps, an alternative with
#   a pair of leading parentheses is proposed consistently: « ¦()C », « ¦()R »,
#   « ¦()P ».
#
#   Order may matter as for "©" U00A9 COPYRIGHT SIGN by « ¦oc » or « ¦Oc », as
#   opposed to "℅" U2105 CARE OF by « ¦co », « ¦Co », « ¦CO » or « ¦cO ».
#
#   Case may matter as for "⅍" U214D AKTIESELSKAB vs "℁" U2101 ADDRESSED TO THE
#   SUBJECT, or for "🄯" U1F12F COPYLEFT SYMBOL vs "℄" U2104 CENTRE LINE SYMBOL.
#
#   Reverse sequences cannot be supported either for "⅍" U214D, because « ¦SA »
#   conflicts with "ر.س" Saudi Riyal by « ¦SAR », and with "♐" U2650 SAGITTARIUS
#   by « ¦SAGI ».
#
#   The fraction-slash-based abbreviations "℀" U2100, "⅍" U214D, "℁" U2101 and
#   "℅" U2105 have alias multikey sequences skipping the slash for brevity, and
#   "℆" U2106 has this alias space terminated to prevent conflicts with a union
#   symbol "∪" U222A multikey sequence based on its nickname.
#
#   « ¦SO » sequences are used fo mathematical symbols, reverse sequences are
#   used for circled letters, other casing pairs are used for German eszett and
#   for the section sign: "§" U00A7 by « ¦sS », as opposed to "ß" U00DF by
#   « ¦ss » or « ¦sz », and "ẞ" U1E9E by « ¦SS » or « ¦Ss ».
#
#   Title case and camel case sequences are also supported; en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#   supports mixed-case sequences as well. E.g. for the Numero sign "№" U2116,
#   it has <Multi_key><N><o> and <Multi_key><N><O>; adding the other two makes
#   for lenient Caps Lock. A trailing underscore however is added consistently
#   with the glyph and with the legacy ordinal indicators "ª" U00AA, "º" U00BA,
#   so as to prevent a conflict with "⊽" U22BD by « ¦NOR ».
#   See #^# Legacy ordinal indicators
#
#   Precomposed ("℃" U2103, "℉" U2109, "Å" U212B) and dedicated ("K" U212A)
#   measurement unit symbols are supported because their use is not discouraged
#   and they are in the Letterlike Symbols block.
#   See #*# RING_ABOVE
#
#   The Letterlike Symbols, however, were not fully supported before v1.6.0.
#   Prior to v1.6.0, important symbols were missing due to not being used in
#   mathematics. This odd time is over since version 1.6.0 added primarily the
#   VERSICLE and RESPONSE symbols "℣" U2123, "℟" U211F, both by multikey and in
#   letter groups 1 and 4.
#   https://forums.steinberg.net/t/versicle-and-response-symbols/729230
#   See # # Letterlike symbols in block U2100 used in mathematics
#
#   Leading or trailing space for distinction is duplicated for nobreakspace
#   support, if synergy with Multi_key or an ASCII symbol matters, consistently
#   with what is done for math symbols.
#   See #   Trailing space
#   See #   Leading space
#
#   Recycling symbols are grouped separately, due to the number of implied
#   sequences.

# # Recycling symbols
#
#   This input method is based on the idea that very widespread and well-known
#   plastic type initialisms should be supported for mnemonics, as well as the
#   initialism "PT" for "plastic type" followed by the conventional number. The
#   remaining numbers are also supported for completeness, and put to good use
#   by supporting the non-numeric symbols "♲" U2672, "♻" U267B, and "♺" U267A
#   associated with digit 8 after 7, rather than 0 that is used for "♲" U2672,
#   consistently with the way the same recycling symbols are supported in the
#   retroflex hook dead key (with alphabetic mnemonic based on R).
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2000/00292-n2240.pdf
#   See #*# RETROFLEX_HOOK
#
#   Semi-numeric sequences based on the "plastic type" initialism are
#   also supported.

#^# Circled numbers
#
#   Another multikey implementation of circled digits and circled or squared
#   letters are multikey equivalents of "Greek or circled" dead key dead_greek,
#   because the multikey equivalent of dead_greek is the at sign, due to shape
#   and since its position is D06, both at levels 3 and 4, where AZERTY has the
#   Y key, that French calls "Greek I" ("i grec"). Extending dead_greek to also
#   support circled is convenient, as Greek does not have dedicated digits.
#   See #*# GREEK_OR_CIRCLED
#
#
# # Circled by leading parenthesis
#
#   For numbers by multikey, this intuitive input method is more comprehensive
#   than the Greek or circled dead key, and it is equally efficient, provided
#   that the redundant trailing parenthesis as found in en_US.UTF-8/Compose is
#   dropped, except for the digits 0 to 5 and two circled numbers starting with
#   1: "⑩" U2469, "⑪" U246A, as these conflict with circled numbers or with box
#   drawings with rounded corners "╰" U2570, "╭" U256D, also known as character
#   cell arcs.
#   See #*# GREEK_OR_CIRCLED
#   See #^# CIRCLED
#   See #   Character cell arcs
#
#   This scheme is supported by multikey only, assuming that the use of
#   dead_invertedbreve as a shortcut for the partial <Multi_key><parenleft>
#   would be considered pointless, and for technical consistency as of not
#   mixing up dead keys and multikey.
#   See #^# Box drawings
#
#   However, this only supports basic circled digits and numbers, for sideways
#   compatibility with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, without the font type and color
#   variants, and without circled letters, as these would conflict with
#   dead_invertedbreve.

#
#   "Æ" U00C6, "æ" U00E6, "Œ" U0152, "œ" U0153 and some other letters are
#   easier input using groups.
#   See #+# GROUP_1
#
#   Titlecase sequences are supported following en_US.UTF-8/Compose, but
#   reverse sequences are not supported since they would not make much sense
#   and are prone to conflicts.
#
#   Superscript digraphs ("𐞀" U10780.."ꝰ" UA770) have sequences starting with
#   the superscript trigger asciicircum, followed by ampersand carrying the
#   polygraph semantic.
#   See #*# SUPERSCRIPT
#   See # # Notes on Unicode support
#
#   Sequences for combining diacritical marks ("ᷔ" U1DD4.."᷏" U1DCF) start with
#   ampersand because this is consistent with the “combining” semantic of
#   ampersand in this context, and given that ampersand is not a multikey
#   equivalent of any dead key.
#   See # # Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols used in mathematics
#
#   The letter EZH is represented by digit 3 as a shortcut, in "𐞊" U1078A and
#   "𐞞" U1079E as opposed to "𐞚" U1079A, while for "𐞟" U1079F it is skipped as
#   non-critical.
#   See ### Multikey sequences
#
#   "Ꝏ" UA74E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER OO is not supported with a titlecase alias,
#   because « ¦Oo » is used for "⊚" U229A CIRCLED RING OPERATOR.
#
#   In the sequences for "᷐" U1DD0 and "𐞉" U10789, the trailing "s" or "z" is
#   skipped as non-critical, for efficiency, at the expense of intuitivity.
#   See ### Multikey sequences
#
#   Conflicting sequences, e.g. with ISO currency codes, are fixed by space
#   termination along the lines of what is done for math symbols. But this only
#   affects "Æ" U00C6, "æ" U00E6, "Ǳ" U01F1, "ʣ" U02A3, "Ƣ" U01A2, "ƣ" U01A3,
#   "ꝳ" UA773, "Ŋ" U014A, "ŋ" U014B, "Þ" U00DE, "þ" U00FE, most of which are
#   supported in letter group 1.
#   See # # Design of math sequences
#   See #+# GROUP_1
#
#   Deprecated presentation forms for typographic ligatures are not supported,
#   given that their use is discouraged:

# # Spaces
#
#   Since all important space characters are supported on live keys as the only

#   and no-break thin space, dead key based input methods, including multikey,
#   are not required.
#   See # # Punctuation spacing for French, regular with U202F NBTSP
#
#   U00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE is supported in en_US.UTF-8/Compose (by « ¦␣␣ »). But
#   the equally or even more useful U202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE is not. Since
#   both are heavily used in French and consistently supported on live keys,
#   and moreover, the multikey sequence for U00A0 <Multi_key><space><space>
#   conflicts with every single math symbol sequence distinguished by multiple
#   leading spaces, sideways compatible support for U00A0 by multikey needs to
#   be dropped as impossible.
#
#   U2008 PUNCTUATION SPACE is supported in en_US.UTF-8/Compose (by « ¦␣. »),
#   but the matching U2007 FIGURE SPACE, that is used with the same rationale
#   in typesetting old-style tables, is not, although the latter is particular
#   in that it is an outstandig reminder that all spaces U2002..U200A were
#   initially designed to be no-break. As <Multi_key><space><period> conflicts
#   with "∙" U2219, "⋅" U22C5, "⋵" U22F5, "⨰" U2A30, "⩑" U2A51, "⩒" U2A52,
#   "⩪" U2A6A, "⫃" U2AC3, "⫄" U2AC4, and distinguishing these would screw them
#   up (by requiring a double leading space), it is discarded, and support for
#   spaces by dead keys is moved to the space groups altogether.

#
#   "–" U2013 EN DASH by <Multi_key><minus><minus><period> is supported in

#   bar dead key. But "—" U2014 EM DASH cannot be supported as-is, i.e. by
#   <Multi_key><minus><minus><minus>, since this is used as the entry point
#   of the high bar dead key. Also, "―" U2015 HORIZONTAL BAR needs support as
#   well, while for an unknown reason — it may even be designed as a ¾-em dash,
#   as in Cambria — en_US.UTF-8/Compose skips this one. It is supported in the
#   high bar dead key by <Multi_key><minus><minus><minus><period>.
#   See #^# DOUBLE_BAR
#   See #^# HIGH_BAR
#
#   As a result, U2014 is moved to the new sequence below, that is the most
#   consistent both with en_US.UTF-8/Compose and with typography, defining the
#   length of the em dash as 4 hyphens.
#
#   This new multikey sequence is not the most user-friendly, but this is only
#   about multikey support. U2013 and U2014, and depending on the variant, also
#   U2015, are in the benefit of level-2 live key positions.

#   Hyphens
#
#   U2010 HYPHEN is not mapped on live key, nor in group 1 of minus, given that

#   team into giving U002D a hybrid glyph, fitting neither the expectations for
#   a hyphen, nor those for a minus sign, fully expressing its genericity
#   pointed out in the Code Chart since version 14.0.0 (2021):
#
#       used generically for hyphen, minus sign or en dash, all of which have
#       dedicated alternatives
#
#   https://www.unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_0000.html
#
#   As a consequence, U002D HYPHEN-MINUS stands out among ASCII punctuation in

#   U2010.

#
#   Noticeable differences are in East Asian width, in the line break class and
#   in the sentence break property.
#
#   The Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm UAX #14 does not require an extra
#   hyphen for non-numerical contexts, and "HYphen" is "Break After".
#   https://unicode.org/reports/tr14/#HY
#
#   East Asian width neither warrants a duplicate hyphen, since Unicode
#   includes UFF0D FULLWIDTH HYPHEN-MINUS, and HYPHEN as "Ambiguous" resolves
#   to "Narrow".
#
#   As of text segmentation, HYPHEN is unspecified, rather than "SContinue"
#   like HYPHEN-MINUS, and the related specification skips "XX" entirely.
#   https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#SContinue
#
#   Bottom line: U2010 is a useless duplicate of U002D and should be prevented
#   from fully deploying its adverse effects by taking up a live key position,
#   or even only an easy-access dead key input method like in group 1 of U002D.
#   Else, U2010 would screw things up, from undeliverable email to broken links
#   to parse errors.
#
#   The reason why Unicode, well aware of the duplicate encoding pitfalls, and
#   carefully avoiding an extra decimal dot, an extra factorial, and an extra
#   punctuation apostrophe, was fooled into double-encoding the hyphen, was the
#   old ISO-8859 misnomer HYPHEN-MINUS, that made its way into ISO/IEC charsets
#   despite ANSI parenthesized "Minus" when designing ASCII, just like "Decimal
#   Point" next.
#   https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub1-2-1977.pdf#page=12
#
#       Parenthesized additions to character names in ASCII
#
#       Space (Normally Nonprinting)
#       Quotation Marks (Diaeresis)
#       Apostrophe (Closing Single Quotation Mark; Acute Accent)
#       Comma (Cedilla)
#       Hyphen (Minus)
#       Period (Decimal Point)
#       Opening Single Quotation Mark (Grave Accent)
#
#   To be consistent, ISO/IEC should have called U002E *PERIOD-DECIMAL-POINT
#   instead of PERIOD, and so on. ISO calling U002D HYPHEN-MINUS instead of
#   *HYPHEN is probably why Unicode encoded U2010, as a matter of getting a
#   character to be named HYPHEN, additionally to encoding U2212 MINUS SIGN.
#
#   If ISO/IEC’s motivation to retain the "-MINUS" appendix was the desire to
#   complete the mathematical base operators beyond U002B PLUS, then why not
#   calling U002A *ASTERISK-MULTIPLY, and U002F *SOLIDUS-DIVIDE? Only "MINUS"
#   was appended with a hyphen, prompting people to figure out a non-existing
#   reason behind, and to guess that this HYPHEN-MINUS might eventually not be
#   a genuine hyphen. Yet it is, and it is repurposed in programming like so
#   many other symbols. That is most probably how Unicode was fooled into
#   encoding an extra hyphen, not noticing that the hyphen was already there.
#
#   Even the most complete Latin ISO charset ISO/IEC 6937, including PLUS-MINUS
#   and other math operators and even HORIZONTAL BAR, does not feature any of
#   hyphen and minus sign other than the well-established 0x2D, despite several
#   unallocated code points. There was no need for backward compatibility.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.51/ISO/IEC_6937#Codepage_layout
#
#   As a consequence, the extra hyphen U2010 should not be taken seriously, in
#   order to prevent adverse effects on keyboard layout design when attempting
#   to support U2010 on live key or by premium dead key like group 1 of minus.
#   There, "⁃" U2043 HYPHEN BULLET is supported instead, while HYPHEN is in
#   group 12, like the outdated legacy ordinal indicators "ª" U00AA, "º" U00BA.
#   See #^# Legacy ordinal indicators
#   See # # C05 minus
#   See # # D01 asciicircum
#   See # # D09 braceright
#
#   By contrast, "‑" U2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN is so important that it is on
#   live key E06, level 2.
#   See dispocla.cpp key <AE06>
#
#
#   Input method for hyphens and dashes
#
#   The dashes based on multiples of the em dash encompass 8 characters listed
#   below. Out of these, seven — all but the ASCII hyphen — are supported by a
#   digit-based multikey scheme including ten dashes and hyphens, additionally
#   to partial support in groups and diacritical dead keys.
#   See # # Long dashes

#   See # # C05 minus
#
#   The mnemonic of "5" for EN DASH is the decimal form "0.5" for "½", while
#   HORIZONTAL BAR is associated with "8" due to keycap-based mnemonics on the
#   unremapped, unlocalized French AZERTY layout where HORIZONTAL BAR is on key
#   E08, level 2. Else, "7" would be convenient, based on "0.75" for "¾"; but
#   the rounded-up value "0.8" falls back on the "8" mnemonic.

#^# Chinantec tone marks
#
#   The dotted Chinantec tone marks "ꜗ" UA717, "ꜘ" UA718 and "ꜙ" UA719 are
#   intuitively supported in dead_abovedot with base characters matching the
#   vertical, diagonal or horizontal dash, but without multikey equivalents,
#   while "ꜚ" UA71A is in dead_horn as a spacing clone of horn.
#   https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barre_de_ton_chinant%C3%A8que
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2004/04349r-chinantec.pdf
#   See #*# DOT_ABOVE
#   See #*# HORN
#
#   For an unconflicting, partially order insensitive emulation of the
#   deactivated multikey sequences in dead_abovedot, case insensitive "C" is
#   prepended. "ꜚ" UA71A is supported consistently with minus-bar sequences.

#^# Zhuang tone letters
#
#   Zhuang tone letters are casing and thus require sequences with letters,
#   most appropriately with Z avoiding conflicts with tone bars, paired with
#   the digit both ways for ease of input. Zhuang tone one is unwritten.

#^# Bracketing tone marks
#
#   The tone height is denoted by a leading initialism, localized in French and
#   in English and case insensitive except the English sequence for "˼" U02FC,
#   because with a capital L, this would conflict with "⊾" U22BE. The start or
#   end semantics is carried by a trailing parenthesis: « ¦h( », « ¦H( »,
#   « ¦b( », « ¦B( », « ¦l( », « ¦L( », or « ¦h) », « ¦H) », « ¦b) », « ¦B) »,
#   « ¦l) ».
#
#   "꜠" UA720 and "꜡" UA721 are supported alongside, as these are ligatures of
#   begin tone marks and stress, adding a median apostrophe to the sequences,
#   with alias sequences featuring rightsinglequotemark instead.

# # Degree sign
#
#   On keyboard layouts sideways compatible with French AZERTY having "°" U00B0
#   on live key E11, level 2, and with a level-5 numpad consistent with this
#   feature, the unavailability of en_US.UTF-8/Compose’s support of the degree
#   sign by <Multi_key><o><o> conflicting with "ꝏ" UA74F LATIN SMALL LETTER OO
#   does not negatively affect the user experience.
#   See dispocla.cpp ## Level-5 numpad
#
#   However, the degree sign is supported by dead key, too, if only to improve
#   the usability of multikey. The most straightforward candidates are "0" and
#   "8" as base characters of dead_abovering, given that "o" is required for
#   "ⱺ" U2C7A. For multikey, the outcome is <Multi_key><asterisk><0> or -<8>,
#   and the dead key working as a de facto shortcut goes <dead_abovering><0> or
#   <dead_abovering><8>.

#   The traditional signs are also included in group 9.
#
#   Input sequences are based on Latin names and on French names and mostly are
#   four characters long, for conflictless consistency. Ultimately however, any
#   redundant characters are cropped for a streamlined user experience and also
#   to avoid superfluous dead keys on Windows.
#   See #   Streamlining
#   See #   Conflictlessness check
#
#   Base 16 numeric sequences are also supported, not conflicting with vulgar
#   fractions where for efficiency, the slash is not mandatory, only supported
#   for intuitivity. These are terminated by asterisk, not started, avoiding
#   conflicts with dead_abovering.

#
#   Be it the one or the other, due to the shape of digit 3, hearts are parsed
#   from the bottom to the top, unlike faces of smilies parsed from the top to
#   the bottom: ":)" or ":-)". This is obvious when looking at the opposite, as
#   "(-:" is in use with the semantic of an actual upside-down face. The fix is
#   to use digit 8 instead, since digit 8 is usable both ways. Hence the
#   sequence used for "♡" U2661 as a math symbol.
#   See "♡" U2661
#   See # # Miscellaneous Symbols in block U2600 used in mathematics
#
#   For completeness, the remaining digits are supported, too, since all these
#   sequences are deactivated consistently as multikey equivalents.
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#   See #^# Bullets
#
#   Previously, the heart emoji logic was followed through, supporting the full
#   set of filled suits (emoji "♥" U2665, "♣" U2663, "♦" U2666, "♠" U2660) and
#   outlined suits (non-emoji "♡" U2661, "♧" U2667, "♢" U2662, "♤" U2664).

# # Symbols for multikey
#
#   Input composition, also known as multikey, may be represented by a low-end
#   alternative "¦" U00A6 additionally to the high-end "⎄" U2384 ISO symbol.
#   The rationale is better font support and a slimmer, less bulky, visually
#   less impacting, less outstanding glyph design in documentation, since the
#   ISO symbol did not make it onto many keyboards, partly because dedicating
#   an entire key to input composition rather than a mere (possibly level-3)
#   key position is not recommended in the presence of a group dead key (UEFD0)
#   providing a more powerful input method for common digraphs. Downgrading the
#   multikey symbol from "⎄" U2384 to "¦" U00A6 consistently stands for a more
#   streamlined, less screwed-up user experience.
#
#   The ISO/IEC 9995-7 symbol "⎄" U2384 is supported by case insensitive
#   « ¦cmp ». Not « ¦com », to prevent conflicts with "℅" U2105.
#

#
#   The broken bar "¦" U00A6 is repurposed as multikey symbol, and consistently
#   it is the dead character of Multi_key. Given that Multi_key double press is
#   not used, this is supported as a means to input "¦" U00A6.

#
#   The sideways compatible sequence « ¦!^ » as in en_US.UTF-8/Compose could be
#   supported in dead_belowdot, but since the relationship to the dead key is
#   merely fortuitous, it is here without the dead key alternative, and without
#   the reverse sequence, that is used in en_US.UTF-8/Compose for letters with

#^# Box drawings
#
#   Being widely used in documentation of keyboard layouts in source code and
#   in plain text email footers, among other usages, box drawings in the Basic
#   Multilingual Plane are supported extensively, for usability, so as to meet
#   expected user expectations.
#   https://www.unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_2500.html
#   https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/025.html
#
#   Box drawings are supported by multikey only, assuming that dead_breve as a
#   shortcut for <Multi_key><parenright> would be considered pointless, and for
#   technical consistency as of not mixing up dead keys and multikey.
#   See # # Circled by leading parenthesis
#
#   The mnemonic uses the leading parenright, as parenright is on C04 "F",
#   consistently with the box drawings’ French name "filets".
#
#   As an exception to the rule, sequences for character cell arcs start with
#   parenleft for graphic mnemonic based on the shape of uppercase letter D on
#   C03, that parenleft is on, and with proximity mnemonic, as the bulk of box
#   drawings starts with parenright on key "F", C04.
#   See #   Character cell arcs
#
#
# # Classic box drawings
#
#   The digit position sets the direction clockwise:
#
#       First digit:  right;
#       Second digit: down;
#       Third digit:  left;
#       Fourth digit: up.
#
#   The digit sets the stroke type:
#
#       0 for none;
#       1 for light;
#       2 for double;
#       3 for heavy.
#
#   Example: <1><0><1><0> : "─" U2500 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT HORIZONTAL.
#
#   Multiple dashes are input by the number of dashes, typed once for light,
#   twice for heavy, terminated by "h" for horizontal, or "v" for vertical,
#   as in <3><h> : "┄" U2504 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT TRIPLE DASH HORIZONTAL, and in
#   <3><3><h> : "┅" U2505 BOX DRAWINGS HEAVY TRIPLE DASH HORIZONTAL.
#
#   Diagonals are input by 1 for the slash slant, 2 for the backslash slant,
#   both 1 and 2 for a cross, and terminated by "d" for diagonal, as in
#   <1><d> : "╱" U2571 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT DIAGONAL UPPER RIGHT TO LOWER LEFT,
#   <1><2><d> : "╳" U2573 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT DIAGONAL CROSS.

#
#   This section is limited to symbols in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of
#   Unicode.
#
#   The General Category "Symbol, other" (So) does not preclude a symbol from
#   being a math symbol, despite there is the dedicated "Symbol, math" (Sm).
#   Indeed both Sm and So are only informative, not normative.
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/UnicodeStandard-15.0.pdf#page=199
#
#   The reason why is that labeling all math symbols as Sm is not feasible,
#   and it is not advisable either, since mathematics repurposed many symbols
#   intrinsically extraneous to mathematics, such as the male and female signs,
#   already supercharged as planet symbols ("♀" U2640, "♂" U2642), three music
#   symbols, one of which is Sm ("♯" U266F) and two, So ("♭" U266D, "♮" U266E),
#   and the first four suits, regardless whether filled or empty ("♠" U2660,
#   "♡" U2661, "♢" U2662, "♣" U2663), but not the last four.
#
#   The derived Unicode property "Math" in turn still only defines a subset of
#   the symbols that need to be supported as math symbols.
#   https://www.unicode.org/Public/15.0.0/ucd/DerivedCoreProperties.txt
#
#   E.g. "⭅" U2B45 and "⭆" U2B46 are not labeled as "Math", yet both are found
#   in TeX math packages and are thus expected to be supported by input methods
#   consistently.

#
# # Design of math sequences
#
#   Mnemonicity
#
#   Supporting all math symbols by multikey would be pointless if this was only
#   to introduce another steep learning curve. Therefore, any multikey sequence
#   must be deducible from the symbol’s shape. To achieve this, every symbol is
#   parsed according to simple rules, applied consistently. Resulting conflicts
#   are uniformly resolved by prepending spaces rather than by arbitrary means,
#   such as randomly duplicating or inverting multikey sequence constituents. A
#   well-designed sequence is mnemonic thanks to its intuitivity.
#
#
#   Streamlining
#
#   Intuitivity and efficiency are key, with the stress on efficiency, so that
#   a sequence may appear truncated because the output is already clear before
#   a pattern is finished, as for "⦭" U29AD, "⦫" U29AB, "⦮" U29AE, "⦯" U29AF.
#   Redundant characters are cropped, even as many as for "⤐" U2910, both for
#   a streamlined user experience and to avoid superfluous dead keys on Windows
#   where composition is implemented using chained dead keys. In XCompose, by
#   contrast, useless trailing multikey sequence constituents are only revealed
#   while checking conflictlessness, and need then to be removed carefully for
#   the purpose of not imposing any useless workload on end users.
#   See #   Conflictlessness check
#
#   When streamlining defeats intuitivity and consistency, more consistent and
#   intuitive sequences are supported alongside, as for "⇺" U21FA, "⇻" U21FB,
#   where the minus standing for the stem next to the arrowhead is optionally
#   supported, because skipping this constituent is unfeasible for "⇷" U21F7,
#   "⇸" U21F8 due to conflicts with horizontal-only special arrows featuring
#   outline heads while the stem is plain: "⇽" U21FD, "⇾" U21FE. (The third one
#   is "⇿" U21FF.) As a result, the vertical counterparts "⤈" U2908, "⤉" U2909
#   have both the streamlined sequences for convenience, and the long sequences
#   for intuitivity.
#
#   Sequences streamlined by cropping non-critical input besides trailing space
#   are duplicated full-length and commented out for the record, in case some
#   need to be restored to prevent conflicts with new sequences.
#   See #Multi_key
#
#
#   Design schemes
#
#   Math sequences are set up using one of two design schemes, or both:
#
#     * Description: ASCII symbols are used as basic shapes and concatenated to
#       mimick the symbol’s shape, as for "⋈" U22C8 BOWTIE and "⨝" U2A1D JOIN;
#
#     * Modification: An ASCII symbol is used as an attribute and appended to a
#       preceding symbol, that may be a single character as for "⁺" U207A, or a
#       description as for "⇖" U21D6.
#
#
#   Parsing order
#
#   Symbols supported by descriptive sequences are parsed consistently with the
#   Latin script, from left to right and from top to bottom. As a result, for
#   many patterns like "⤧" U2927, parsing starts in the upper left corner.
#   Consistently, it also goes down the z axis first, if there is any, as in
#   "⤫" U292B, "⤬" U292C.
#
#   Symbols for angles, however, are parsed counter-clockwise, for consistency
#   and to keep things simple and straightforward.
#   See #   Angle symbols
#
#
#   Order sensitivity
#
#   As far as possible, descriptive sequences of symmetric symbols such as
#   "⋈" U22C8 BOWTIE and "⨝" U2A1D JOIN are fully or partly symmetric for the
#   purpose of enhancing UX. The same holds true for sequences with attributes,
#   with this section supporting trailing attributes, while related dead keys
#   have multikey equivalents with the attribute in leading position.
#   See "⨢" U2A22
#   See "⨣" U2A23
#   See # # Superscript or subscript signs, symbol, punctuation
#   See "⁺" U207A
#
#   By contrast, many sequences are required to be order sensitive, as for
#   "±" U00B1 and "∓" U2213, "⨤" U2A24 and "⨦" U2A26.
#   See # # Plus minus
#
#
#   Trailing space
#
#   For a conflictless support of variable length sequences, space termination
#   is required for many math symbols, unless trailing space is non-critical.
#   Both ASCII space and Latin-1 no-break space are supported as terminating
#   space, the no-break space because in French mode, it is mapped at level 3,
#   in synergy with the ASCII symbols, that are likely to occur at the end of
#   math symbol multikey sequences; if not, U+00A0 is supported regardless, for
#   consistency and maintainability and with respect to a following number that
#   may need to be connected to the symbol by a no-break space.
#
#
#   Leading space
#
#   When things do not work as expected, the likely culprit is a conflict with
#   a dead key equivalent as for "≪" U226A, "≫" U226B, "⋘" U22D8, "⋙" U22D9.
#   To fix these issues, sequences start with a space, or interchangeably with
#   a no-break space, supported for the sake of synergy with the Multi_key dead
#   key, mapped invariably at level 3, both in French mode, where it is on key
#   E12, and in ASCII mode where it is also on key D12; yet the space character
#   at level 3 is no-break space in French mode, ASCII space in ASCII mode.
#
#   Leading space is also used to distinguish math sequences from each other,
#   in case intuitivity requires similar sequences for different symbols, like
#   for "⋈" U22C8 BOWTIE and "⨝" U2A1D JOIN. This scheme may require prepending
#   multiple spaces. In that case, the level-3 modifier may be released before
#   any of them, also in French mode when level 3 of the space bar is no-break
#   space.
#
#   Examples involving single or multiple leading [nobreak]space:
#   Single:    "∕" U2215, "∖" U2216, "∣" U2223, "∼" U223C;
#   Double:    "⧸" U29F8, "⧂" U29C2, "⧜" U29DC, "◽" U25FD, "⤶" U2936;
#   Triple:    "⟋" U27CB and "⟍" U27CD;
#   Quadruple:  "⁄" U2044 and "⧵" U29F5.
#
#
#   Negation
#
#   Negated sequences work the other way around: letters first, slash last,
#   to further prevent conflicts with dead key equivalents, as in "∄" U2204,
#   "∅" U2205, "∉" U2209.
#
#   However, to distinguish partial negations from full negations, the slash
#   may not be the last character, as for "≇" U2247 versus "≆" U2246. Other
#   examples include "⊈" U2288 versus "⊊" U228A, "⋢" U22E2 versus "⋤" U22E4.
#
#
#   Reverse symbols
#
#   For opposite or reverse relationships, when the symbol is turned, flipped
#   horizontally or vertically, a matching alternate slug is used, as well as
#   a trailing percent sign or a trailing backslash with dead key semantics,
#   so as to provide both a streamlined and an intuitive input method. Most
#   slugs use graphic mnemonics, while H and CP use alphabetic mnemonics based
#   on HARP for "∇" U2207 or on COPRODUCT for "∐" U2210. Examples:
#
#   Symbol A   Slug |  Symbol B   Slug  Alternative with trailing transform
#   "∈" U2208  e    |  "∋" U220B  p     e\
#   "⊂" U2282  c    |  "⊃" U2283  b     c\
#   "∆" U2206  D    |  "∇" U2207  H     D%
#   "∨" U2228  v    |  "∧" U2227  a     v%
#   "⩖" U2A56  w    |  "⩕" U2A55  aa    w%
#   "⨈" U2A08  W    |  "⨇" U2A07  AA    W%
#   "∏" U220F  P    |  "∐" U2210  CP    P%
#
#
#   Slanted symbols
#
#   Some slanted math symbols are glyph variants selected by VS1 UFE00.
#   https://www.unicode.org/Public/16.0.0/ucd/StandardizedVariants.txt
#   https://unicode.org/Public//6.2.0/ucd/StandardizedVariants.html
#
#   But many math symbols with slanted equal sign are hard-coded characters:
#   "⩽" U2A7D, "⩾" U2A7E, "⩿" U2A7F, "⪀" U2A80, "⪁" U2A81, "⪂" U2A82,
#   "⪃" U2A83, "⪄" U2A84, "⪓" U2A93, "⪔" U2A94, "⪕" U2A95, "⪖" U2A96,
#   "⪗" U2A97, "⪘" U2A98, "⪛" U2A9B, "⪜" U2A9C, "⪨" U2AA8, "⪩" U2AA9,
#   "⫹" U2AF9, "⫺" U2AFA. Some of these do not have straight equivalents.
#   https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/1521
#
#   If the slanted form is not canonical, and there is a competing straight and
#   horizontal (single-line or double-line) equal, as for "⪙" U2A99, "⪚" U2A9A
#   versus "⪛" U2A9B, "⪜" U2A9C, the slanted one is distinguished by trailing
#   grave, with mnemonics based on the slant of the backtick.
#
#   (This scheme is better than repurposing the underscore for slanted, and
#   introducing minus for not slanted, screwing up some arrows in the process.)
#
#
#   Underscore and overscore
#
#   While sequences of double-line-equal symbols are built with the equal sign,
#   single-line equal translates to underscore throughout, at any position in
#   the symbol: bottom, center, and top, This scheme also enhances sideways
#   compatibility with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, that does not support any slanted
#   form, and uses underscore for single-line equal in "≤" U2264, "≥" U2265.
#
#   Consistently, an overscore as in "⊼" U22BC and "⊽" U22BD translates to a
#   leading underscore in the sequence, while for "⊻" U22BB, the underscore is
#   in trailing position, as vertically stacked symbols are parsed from top to
#   bottom.
#
#   However, for intuitivity, underscore is used in alternative sequences for
#   combining arrows and harpoons below "⃬" U20EC.."⃯" U20EF, as opposed to the
#   same above where only minus is used for the stem.
#
#   The long dash in "⥪" U296A, "⥫" U296B, "⥬" U296C, "⥭" U296D is considered
#   as an under- or overscore rather than a barbless harpoon, due to the effect
#   of underscore causing less conflicts than minus (only a single one:
#   "⥭" U296D with "₋" U208B), and as a result, requiring less leading spaces,
#   for a more streamlined user experience.
#
#
#   Arrows and harpoons
#
#   Arrows are better supported thanks to this scheme, with the minus dedicated
#   to horizontal stems, the exclamation mark to vertical stems, the slash and
#   backslash to diagonal stems, while the pipe is required for an actual bar,
#   as in "⤆" U2906, "⤇" U2907, "↥" U21A5, "↧" U21A7.
#
#   Since double arrows also occur in all eight directions, non-horizontal ones
#   use appended equal in conjunction with \, !, / for the few existing, mainly
#   the basic "⇑" U21D1, "⇓" U21D3, "⇕" U21D5, "⇖" U21D6, "⇗" U21D7, "⇘" U21D8
#   and "⇙" U21D9. As a result, "⇕" U21D5 is input like "↕" U2195 with appended
#   equal.
#
#   Triple and quadruple arrows use appended digit 3 or 4, as for "⇛" U21DB,
#   "⟰" U27F0, "⟱" U27F1, "⤊" U290A, "⤋" U290B. In this role, digits are
#   appended like those denoting size as for "◻" U25FB, while multiplying
#   digits are prepended as for "⇇" U21C7, "⇶" U21F6, "∬" U222C, "⋐" U22D0.
#
#   Long arrows like "⟶" U27F6, being horizontal throughout, are composed with
#   double minus or double equal for brevity, as well as triple minus or triple
#   equal for unconflicting consistency with "⟿" U27FF, "⬳" U2B33, to ensure
#   a versatile user experience, where it is up to the user to pick consistency
#   or efficiency as their top priority.
#
#   Squiggle arrows "⇜" U21DC, "⇝" U21DD, "⟿" U27FF, "⬳" U2B33 use asciitilde
#   at least twice, for intuitivity. As a result, the triple asciitilde of the
#   long variants is consistent only with triple minus/equal variant sequences
#   of the other long arrows, due to single asciitilde being required for wave
#   arrows "↜" U219C, "↝" U219D (the directly pointing variants "⤳" U2933 and
#   "⬿" U2B3F have a minus stem segment before their arrowhead), while normal
#   length squiggle arrows "⇜" U21DC, "⇝" U21DD are intuitively input by the
#   means of double asciitilde sequences.
#
#   Vertical arrow heads are composed as if they were turned 90° to the left,
#   because stacked symbols are parsed from top to bottom; heads of up arrows
#   translate to less, as for "↑" U2191, "⇑" U21D1, "⦽" U29BD; heads of down
#   arrows become greater, as for "↓" U2193, "⇓" U21D3.
#
#   Harpoon barbs, by contrast, become grave or apostrophe/rightsinglequotemark
#   depending on their slant, regardless of stem direction.
#
#
#   Angle symbols
#
#   Angles are parsed counter-clockwise in the geometrically positive direction
#   while translating a horizontal angle leg to minus, like a horizontal arrow
#   stem, not underscore, because we have "⦤" U29A4 and "⦥" U29A5 including an
#   actual underscore, and also to prevent too many conflicts with subscript
#   parentheses "₍" U208D, "₎" U208E in the sequences of "⦨" U29A8.."⦯" U29AF.
#
#   By contrast, vertical angle legs are bar, as in "⟀" U27C0, not exclam like
#   vertical arrow stems.
#
#   For simplicity, right angle is "L", as in "∟" U221F, "⊾" U22BE, "⦜" U299C.
#
#   All angle symbols are parsed as interior angles, not reflex angles. Some
#   symbols are explicit about this, like "∡" U2221; others like "∠" U2220 are
#   assumed to refer to the same angle.
#
#

#
#   As rightsinglequotemark is on the apostrophe key in French mode, sequences

# # Invisible operators
#
#   For intuitivity, these sequences use a leading ampersand, like those of the
#   combining diacritics used in mathematics, that invisible operators have the
#   lack of advance width in common with.
#   See # # Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols used in mathematics
#
#   This scheme prevents "⨯" U2A2F from needing two leading spaces rather than
#   a single one, to distinguish it from "×" U00D7.
#
#   Thanks to conflictlessness, space termination is skipped throughout. The
#   resulting uncertainty due to the lack of visual feedback is mitigated by
#   the cursor advance when a space is typed hereafter.
#
#   Two of these are supported on live keys: "⁣" U2063 INVISIBLE SEPARATOR on
#   B07, "⁤" U2064 INVISIBLE PLUS on C06.

# # Superscript or subscript signs, symbol, punctuation

#   These are primarily supported by the dead keys dedicated to superscripts
#   and subscripts, not included in keysymdef.h but required for full Unicode
#   support.
#
#   Unlike half of the below, the multikey equivalents in super/subscript are

# # Letterlike symbols in block U2100 used in mathematics
#
#   Sequences for double-struck or outlined symbols use duplication, script is
#   a trailing asciitilde, blackletter is numbersign, Hebrew gets a trailing
#   backslash based on the shape of aleph (here the symbol "ℵ" U2135) although
#   backslash is also the ASCII equivalent of reversed, Greek gets a trailing
#   at sign, and italic translates to a trailing slash although this is used to
#   denote negation in other instances: "∄" U2204, "∅" U2205.
#
#   Many of these are included in groups 6 to 10, where the complete sets of
#   alphanumeric mathematical symbols are supported. Not so the liter symbol
#   "ℓ" U2113, as "𝓁" U1D4C1 is encoded separately.

#   For "⋈" U22C8 BOWTIE and "⨝" U2A1D JOIN, slash and backslash can be hit in
#   any order. This enables pressing them simultaneously and prevents screwing
#   up these symbols, as opposed to making slash-backslash a shortcut for JOIN,
#   reserving backslash-slash for BOWTIE, under the rule that parsing starts in
#   the upper left corner.

#   The sequences of "⦨" U29A8.."⦯" U29AF are composed parsing the symbols in
#   the positive direction, counter-clockwise, and the arrowed angle leg like
#   an arrow stem and head. With respect to "⦤" U29A4, "⦥" U29A5 and to prevent
#   conflicts with "₍" U208D and "₎" U208E, a horizontal leg is minus, like a
#   horizontal arrow stem, not underscore. For efficiency, the trailing slash
#   of "⦫" U29AB is cropped, and so are the trailing less and backslash of
#   "⦭" U29AD, the trailing greater of "⦮" U29AE, and the bar of "⦯" U29AF.

#   "⧵" U29F5 REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR is likely a duplicate of "∖" U2216 SET
#   MINUS with the potential to fool people into decisions causing issues, e.g.
#   “\setminus translated as U29F5 ⧵ REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR causes problems”
#   https://github.com/tudace/tuda_latex_templates/issues/409
#
#   Consistently, "⧵" U29F5 goes unmentioned in TUS, Table 22-5. Mathematical
#   Operators Disunified from Punctuation, as disunifying this from "\" U005C
#   was pointless. As a consequence, people are left stranded when attempting
#   to make sense of this code point.
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/UnicodeStandard-15.0.pdf#page=903&zoom=100,0,500
#
#   Fonts may give the duplicate a slight difference in slant. One example is
#   DejaVu Sans Mono Book.
#
#   "∕" U2215 DIVISION SLASH, by contrast, does not have any *SOLIDUS OPERATOR
#   equivalent. Therefore, U29F5 is distinguished by a quadruple leading space.
#   For convenience, these [back]slash symbols are alternatively distinguished
#   by a trailing digit, also those with a single leading space for consistency
#   in the related dead key (without space termination).

#
#   Since the maximum number of keysyms is 9, including the initial Multi_key
#   press, many LaTeX commands need to be truncated to make working multikey
#   sequences out of them, limiting this input method’s usability.
#
#   Most short sequences require space termination to prevent conflicts with
#   longer sequences starting the same way. This is consistent with the way
#   TeX control words are terminated.

### Greek with diacritics
#
#   Polytonic Greek is supported alongside to meet eventual user expectations,
#   despite its exclusion from the French NF Z71-300:2019 standard. To achieve
#   this, precomposed polytonic Greek letters are supported, although Unicode
#   advises to use Greek base letters with combining diacritics instead, since
#   not providing the ability to input diacriticized Greek letters by dead key
#   may be considered counter-intuitive. The only cross-platform compatible
#   way to achieve this requires precomposed letters, so as to avoid composed
#   dead key output.
#   https://www.unicode.org/faq/greek.html
#
#   As a consequence, dead keys for Latin diacritics are extended consistently,
#   except that for mnemonics, dead_invertedbreve and dead_breve stand for the
#   dasia and psili aspiration marks, instead of the latter for breve length.
#   The few occurrences of precomposed vrachy are in dead_caron, with the
#   mnemonic upside that the mapping of dead_caron on the V key also matches
#   the initial of vrachy.
#   See # # Dead key layout overview
#   See # # Order of dead key lists
#
#       dead_acute              oxia
#       dead_grave              varia
#       dead_circumflex         perispomeni
#       dead_diaeresis          dialytika
#       dead_caron              vrachy
#       dead_macron             makron
#       *dead_abovehook UEFD3   koronis
#       dead_invertedbreve      dasia
#       dead_breve              psili
#       dead_belowdot           ypogegrammeni/prosgegrammeni
#
#   Monotonic Greek is supported as a part of polytonic Greek, because tonos
#   can be emulated using oxia instead, as since 1986, acute is the official
#   tonos.
#   https://www.opoudjis.net/unicode/unicode_gkbkgd.html#oxia
#
#   However, for any eventuality, tonos as such is also supported, using
#   dead_doubleacute, on the "E" key D03, with additional alphabetic mnemonic
#   based on the initial of Elliniká:
#
#       dead_doubleacute        tonos

# # End note about polytonic Greek
#
#   Here ends the section dedicated to polytonic Greek (that also supports
#   monotonic Greek alongside). The Greek base alphabet for technical use is
#   in the Latin dead key section, Greek dead key, that also supports circled,
#   consistently with its multikey equivalent "@".
#   See #*# GREEK
#
#   As this file is part of a Latin keyboard layout, the polytonic Greek part
#   is not included in the multikey tables and dead key tables documenting its
#   dead key content. Indeed, polytonic Greek is supported only in an attempt
#   to meet eventual user expectations raised by the comprehensive dead key set
#   supported for completeness with respect to the Latin script. In the context
#   of a 100% comprehensive support for Latin script, and given that polytonic
#   Greek is extensively used in Latin culture, unsupporting polytonic Greek is
#   not an option.
