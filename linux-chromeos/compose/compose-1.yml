#   * In Unicode CLDR, this platform is labeled ChromeOS, and it is explained that
#     in the CLDR, *Linux* is supported alongside *ChromeOS*, or through ChromeOS.
#
#               Installation: 1. Set the input method to XIM, because other input methods may
#                                not support multi-character output, including composed letters
#                                required for Unicode conformant output on dead keys; and with
#                                the input method set to none, this Compose is not compiled.
#
#                                The following command activates the X Window Input Method:
#                                    im-config -n xim
#
#                                The currently active input method displays on line 2 after:
#                                    im-config -m
#
#                                Setting the input method to XIM to begin with is essential,
#                                because distros may not ship XIM as the default.
#
#                             2. Make sure to be using the full-length file Compose.yml.
#
#                             3. Proceed following method A, B, or C:
#
#                                A. Most backward compatible:
#                                   1. Back up the file /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#                                   2. Append Compose.yml to /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#
#                                      Prepending rather than appending breaks U1E7A and U1E7B
#                                      overriding U01D5 and U01D6, and "V́" and "v́" overriding
#                                      U01D7 and U01D8 as defined in en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#                                B. Shared computer with User Compose:
#                                   1. Back up the file ~/.XCompose.
#                                   2. Append Compose.yml to ~/.XCompose.
#
#                                C. Shared computer without User Compose:
#                                   1. Copy Compose.yml to ~/.XCompose.
#                                   2. Optionally uncomment the following line:
#
#                                       include "%L"
#
#                                   Required for using non-Latin keyboard layouts
#                                   supported in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, default for fr_FR.
#
#                             The changes take effect in any application after reopening it, or
#                             after opening a new session if the input method needs to be changed.
#
#             Uninstallation: A, B: Restore the previously backed-up original Compose file.
#                             C:    Delete this Compose file.

#                               Consistently with the Cistercian “Soli Deo Gloria”, picked up
#                               during the Reformation as one of the five Solae. See Mt 10,32
#                               about publicly confessing (and acknowledging) Jesus Christ.
#                               Impiety triggered design mistakes fixed in versions 2..4. So,
#                               the ASCII map was messy without making room for the euro sign
#                               until v2.0 when it ultimately became practical and respectful
#                               thanks to God helping and advising about the layout details.
#                               The superscripts were on the wrong level, and modifiers for
#                               titlecase polygrams "Cʼh" and "Nᵒ " were unintuitive, due to
#                               not seeking advice from God until ultimately v3.0 came up.
#                               And spaced-out punctuation was mapped with the wrong modifier
#                               AltFr instead of Shift, with a semblance of logic but without
#                               real usability, due to never asking God which modifier is the
#                               correct one for spaced-out punctuation, until ultimately that
#                               mess too came up and was fixed in v4.0. The bottomline is that
#                               development was delayed from 2016 when a workable solution was
#                               overdue, to 2024-08 when the messy standard NF Z71-300 released
#                               in 2019-04 was under revision (with a deadline on 2024-07-31),
#                               due to only reluctantly praying God for help and advice, rather
#                               than following the straightforward way roadmapped in the Bible.

### Multicharacter strings for live keys
#
#   Dead key handling XCompose has the ability to output more than one single
#   code unit, outperforming the misdesigned Windows Text Services Framework,
#   that can do so by live keys only, and is limited to 16 (not 4) UTF-16 code
#   units, as opposed to XCompose, that has no upper limit and also handles
#   multicharacter strings on single live key press.
#   https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.html
#   https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/man5/Compose.5.html
#   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ComposeKey#Compose_key
#   https://wiki.debian.org/XCompose
#
#   However, for the multicharacter feature to be effective and actually work,
#   activating the X Window Input Method, XIM for short, is mandatory.
#   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xkeyboard-config/+bug/1584314/comments/6
#   http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man8/im-config.8.html
#   https://askubuntu.com/questions/129680/how-can-i-make-ibus-not-ignore-xcompose
#
#   In XCompose, a single keysym hapax is processed for direct output, whereas
#   a keysym followed by another keysym at least once is handled as a dead key
#   throughout, and its singleton output is discarded. Thus, the system “eats”
#   the dead key press if the input sequence is undefined.
#
#   Definition format in XCompose files:
#
#       * Single character output may be defined like in allocation tables,
#         but this format is reportedly not interoperable across XKB.
#       * Strings must be defined as literals delimited by double quotes.
#         This is the interoperable format for single character output, too.
#
#   Both formats may be used concurrently. Therefore, single character output
#   is defined both as a string, which is mandatory, and as a keysym providing
#   a redundant convenience. However, on the result side, the preferred keysyms
#   are Unicode scalars rather than X11 keysyms, that have limited coverage and
#   are not directly interoperable.
#
#   Definition format in allocation tables (Symbols directory):
#   Single character output in any UCS plane may be defined in several formats:
#
#       * Uxxxx[x[x]] hexadecimal
#       * U00xxxxxx hexadecimal
#       * 0x01xxxxxx hexadecimal
#
#   The specified format "\0x123A" does not seem to work.
#   https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.html
#
#   These layouts make extensive use of added keysyms as in keysymdef.h:97.
#   /usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h
#   https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/keysymdef.h
#
#   The scheme using Private Use characters instead of missing dead keysyms is
#   found on FDO as well as on GNOME.
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19506
#   https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=537457#c7

#   Unicode Private Use areas are managed by CSUR and UCSUR.

#
#
# # Notes about syntax
#
#   On all lines containing a compose sequence to be parsed by the compiler, a
#   comment is mandatory, for compatibility with non-conformant compilers that
#   do not parse compose sequences without a comment before the EOL. According
#   to the spec, section “File Format”, comments are optional.
#   https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.html
#
#   The plus sign in Unicode code points is omitted, also in comments, except
#   in quotations and in result strings used as placeholders of high surrogates
#   and intended for display to end-users. This scheme is interoperable with
#   the code parsed by the Compose compiler, for easier maintenance and easier
#   reference, using a specially formatted version of UnicodeData.txt by the
#   script format-UnicodeData-txt.pl.

#   The Public Office of the Breton language OPLB/OPAB has requested the letter
#   apostrophe to be featured on the NF Z71-300 standard keyboard layouts.

#
#   Consistently, in Microsoft’s implementation of NF Z71-300:2019 AZERTY, the
#   first rule of the “Caractères européens additionnels” dead key, whose dead

#
#   The Breton trigraph is regularly composed of a "c" and an "h" separated by
#   a letter apostrophe U02BC, not a punctuation apostrophe U2019, in order to
#   avoid inaccurate word boundaries.

#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/main/br.xml#L1264
#
#   The variants for Breton and French "kbbrFRs" and "kbbrFRsr" have the Breton
#   trigraph on Base and Shift levels of key E01 additionally to the support of
#   the Breton trigraph on (Shift +) AltGr + AltFr + A.
#
#   The Breton trigraph got mnemonic keysyms in keysymdef.h, configured here to
#   ensure regular support.

# # Automated punctuation spacing for fr-FR, regular with U202F NBTSP
#
#   This is regular typesetting at Imprimerie nationale except for colon and
#   quotation marks, although the latter are typeset with narrow space in the
#   Imprimerie nationale style guide _Lexique des règles typographiques en
#   usage à l’Imprimerie nationale_, Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 2002; only
#   the rule on page 149 differs.
#
#   In mainstream high-quality publishing, referred to as new school, no-break
#   thin space is used throughout.
#   https://forums.macg.co/threads/typo-caracteres-capitales-accentues.25739/page-5#post-3151119
#
#   Philippe Verdy reported on the Unicode Public mailing list that the most
#   straightforward Unicode character representing this no-break thin space is
#   NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE U+202F.
#   https://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2015-m06/0220.html
#
#   Indeed, U202F NNBSP, a.k.a. no-break thin space, is a character that,
#   despite being encoded for Mongolian with specific handling intended, was
#   readily ripped off for use in French, Philippe Verdy reported, to that
#   extent that it is ultimately an encoding error in Mongolian that brought
#   the long-missing no-break thin space into the UCS, in the block that it
#   actually belongs to, and where it had been encoded in the beginning if
#   there had been no desire to keep it proprietary. That is the hidden (almost
#   occult) fact where stances like “The NNBSP can be used to represent the
#   narrow space occurring around punctuation characters in French typography,
#   which is called an ‘espace fine insécable.’ ” (TUS) and “When NARROW
#   NO-BREAK SPACE occurs in French text, it should be interpreted as an
#   ‘espace fine insécable’.” (UAX #14) are stemming from. The underlying
#   meaning is like: “The no-break thin space is usually a vendor-specific
#   layout control in DTP applications; it’s also available via a TeX command.

#
#   Imprimerie nationale, France does not formally categorize punctuation marks
#   into big punctuation and small punctuation or double punctuation and simple
#   punctuation, nor does it support all punctuation marks: The em dash and the
#   en dash are merged, and the single angle quotation marks U2039 and U203A go
#   unmentioned. Part of the punctuation is spaced out using either of:
#
#       * No-break justifying space, behaving like Unicode’s NBSP U00A0;
#       * No-break thin space, behaving like Unicode’s NBTSP U202F.
#
#   Which one exactly depends on the punctuation mark and on whether we want to
#   know the rules in use at Imprimerie nationale, or if it is about the usage.
#   The semicolon and the question and exclamation marks are typeset exactly as
#   stated in the style guide with a no-break thin space. The colon too, with a
#   no-break justifying space. The double angle quotation marks are ruled like
#   colon but typeset like semicolon.
#
#   The no-break thin space is the "espace fine insécable" quoted in Unicode,
#   a no-break clone of Unicode’s thin space TSP U2009. Consistently, in CLDR,
#   U202F is the no-break thin space, short NBTSP, since 2024-08-02T0242+0200.

#
#   When U202F was still mainly called NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE, U2009 THIN SPACE
#   was called "narrow space" for consistency, and abbreviated "NSP".

#
#   Unicode was supposed to encode SI/BIPM number typesetting as well as French
#   punctuation typesetting, and for that purpose encoded THIN SPACE along with
#   other typographic space characters in the range U2000..U200A. Accordingly,
#   the line breaking property was set to no-break for all spaces starting with
#   U2002, after the two widest spaces in a breaking variant: U2000, U2001, as
#   opposed to U2002, U2003, consistently with TeX, where `\qquad` and `\quad`
#   are breaking, while `\emspace`, `\enspace` and `\thinspace` are no-break.
#   The TeXbook is not very clear about that, but obviously this difference was
#   well known and fostered the original typographical space range design.
#   https://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/knuth/dist/tex/texbook.tex
#   https://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/Archives-Old/UML023/0536.html
#
#   But that design goal was ultimately compromised. To cover up the vandalism,
#   U2007 FIGURE SPACE was left no-break with the hypocritical allegation that
#   this space is used “in” numbers, while it was encoded as the tabular space,
#   to be used before numbers when typesetting tables the old way, alongside an
#   equivalent indentation by the width of a decimal dot or comma, using U2008.
#   https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-51.html
#
#       This is the preferred space to use in numbers. It has the same width as
#       a digit and keeps the number together for the purpose of line breaking.
#
#   The corrected Unicode position is found in UAX #14 since 2008, in TUS
#   since 2014: The Unicode Standard, version 7.0.0, 2014, p. 265, section 6.2,
#   heading “Space Characters” (see subheading “Narrow No-Break Space”).
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch06.pdf#G1834
#
#   Also: The Unicode Standard, version 15.0.0, 2022, p. 268, subheading
#   “Narrow No-Break Space”, e.g. in the full text PDF:

#
#      Narrow No-Break Space. U+202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE (NNBSP) is a narrow
#      version of U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE. The NNBSP can be used to represent the
#      narrow space occurring around punctuation characters in French
#      typography, which is called an “espace fine insécable.”
#
#   In UAX #14, it started with the “Proposed Update Unicode Standard Annex #14
#   Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm”, Unicode 5.1 Draft 3, 2008-03-07.
#   https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-21.html#GL
#
#   15 years later, 2023-08-15: Unicode® Standard Annex #14,
#   Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm, Unicode 15.1.0:
#   https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-51.html#NNBSPdoc
#
#      When NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE occurs in French text, it should be
#      interpreted as an “espace fine insécable”.
#
#   The Unicode position reflects also in a Script Ad Hoc Group (since 2024-03:
#   Script Encoding Working Group) recommendation made on 2019-07-22 for the
#   Unicode Technical Committee meeting #160.

#
#      The Unicode Standard includes several different space characters.
#      It is acceptable to use THIN SPACE, and then use a higher-level protocol,
#      a word joiner, or tailored line-breaking to prevent line-breaking.
#      Alternatively, NNBSP can be used to force no-break behavior.
#
#   However, higher level protocols and tailoring are inacceptable options when
#   considered for the purpose of digitally representing natural languages, the
#   more as the Unicode Standard specifies that it encodes plain text.
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/UnicodeStandard-15.0.pdf#page=45
#
#   In Unicode CLDR, French migrated from NBSP to NNBSP, i.e. NBTSP, wherever
#   applicable, in 2018, when CLDR 34 was released on 2018-10-15.
#
#   In the release note, section Detailed Data Changes:
#   https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-34#h.q1mr39yetx2z_l
#
#      The French locale now uses narrow no-break space U+202F in several
#      places: as the numeric grouping separator, in many short unit patterns,
#      and in the locale display name patterns. It also changed normal space to
#      no-break space U+00A0 in the wide unit patterns.
#
#   In the release note, section Migration:
#   https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-34#h.fm1q7yof3rxz_l
#
#      French grouping separator changed from no-break space U+00A0 to
#      narrow no-break space U+202F.

#
#   Venetian got its CLDR coverage level raised in 2023, adding the decimal
#   separator and the group separator to the covered data. Since CLDR 44 was
#   released on 2023‑10‑31, the group separator in Venetian is set to U202F,
#   making Venetian the second locale to implement the BIPM recommendation.

#
#   There are other 50+ locales using a space as a numeric group separator, and
#   this space is supposed to be a thin space, so there is no other option than

#   Canadian French, keep sticking with NBSP U00A0 for the time being.

#
# # Justifying no-break spaces
#
#   NO-BREAK SPACE U00A0 is tailored as fixed-width in word processors other
#   than Microsoft Word 2013, because it is misused for punctuation spacing in
#   lieu of U202F NBTSP, so that it raises issues in Polish, Russian and other
#   locales requiring no-break space as interword space, and thus requiring the
#   no-break space to be justifying as defined. This tailoring without settings
#   for NBSP justification and for the space used in French punctuation spacing
#   and without even locale sensitivity results in an abuse that makes sense as
#   part of the downgrading policy intended to limit word processors’ usability
#   for the interoperable representation of the world’s languages.

### Multikey sequences
#
#   The described behavior of XCompose is based on en_US.UTF-8/Compose,
#   as it is used in France.
#
#   The maximum number of keysyms is nine. Longer sequences are ignored.
#
#
# # Notes for maintenance
#
#   The colon alignment in column 100 is based on longest multikey sequences
#   in terms of string length, as used for U10789, U107AB.
#
#   For maintainability, there is no space between the leading keysyms, but
#   part of the keysyms may be aligned to the end for readability.
#
#   The multikey equivalent is added below each dead key sequence by a script
#   called generate-multikey.pl, run by multikey.sh, if the sequence is
#   marked up accordingly. For portability, multikey equivalents are present
#   regardless whether they make sense, and whether they barely work. So,
#   three multikey sequences do not work because <numbersign> is used both
#   as a group dead key and as a base character:
#
#       <Multi_key><numbersign>                        <numbersign> : "☐" U2610 # BALLOT BOX
#       <Multi_key><numbersign><numbersign>            <numbersign> : "☑" U2611 # BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK emoji
#       <Multi_key><numbersign><numbersign><numbersign><numbersign> : "☒" U2612 # BALLOT BOX WITH X
#
#   With respect to dead key use, these sequences are maintained, but Multi_key
#   equivalents are actionable only elsewhere.
#   See # # C01 numbersign
#   See #^# Square boxes
#
#   As a consequence, the multikey equivalents of U2610, U2611 and U2612 in the
#   first three groups of numbersign are involved in unavoidable conflicts. All
#   other conflicts and duplicates are checked and fixed using a protocol like
#   this, where the first steps may be automated by `bhughes339.replacerules`
#   extension for VSCode.
#
#   Base letters are flagged for case, because even case sensitive, the default
#   sort order prioritizing string length over case hides many conflicts due to
#   case, sorting A > a > Ab > ab instead of A > Ab > a > ab.

# # Notes about documentation
#
#   The plus sign omitted in Unicode code points for interoperability needs to
#   be readded for documentation.
#   See # # Notes about syntax
#
#   This file is also the source code for HTML table partials, such as those by
#   the scripts generate-multikey-tables.pl and generate-math-table.pl
#   documenting multikey sequences, and those by generate-deadkey-tables.pl
#   documenting dead keys, including the letter groups and the symbol groups.
#
#   The generate-multikey-tables.pl script, processing the multikey section,
#   expects a caret between the leading hashes of a subsection heading to start
#   an HTML table partial file, while in the dead key division, another script,
#   generate-deadkey-tables.pl, expects an asterisk between the hashes in the
#   same position. The dead key tables are numbered, while the multikey tables
#   are not, since their number is not finite. Adding a new file start heading
#   does not alter existing file names. However, each of these headings is used
#   to make a file name, and they are expected to be unique.
#
#   The letter groups and symbol groups are also documented on screenshots of
#   two spreadsheets. These have plain text dumps in this file.
#   See # # Symbol groups overview

#   Dchar: "¦" U00A6
#
#   The generate-multikey-tables.pl script requires a caret between the leading
#   hashes of a subsection heading to start a new subsection partial table file
#   while processing the multikey section.
#   See # # Notes about documentation
#
#   The broken bar "¦" U00A6 is repurposed as multikey symbol.
#   See # # Symbols for multikey and composition
#
#   For readability, inline literal multikey sequences are bracketed with
#   French-style no-break thin space padded double angle quotation marks,
#   because quotedbl, backtick, period, comma and other ASCII symbols likely
#   to occur next to multikey sequences may also be part of multikey seqences.

#
#^# Legacy ordinal indicators
#
#   The two Latin-1 ordinal indicators "ª" U00AA FEMININE ORDINAL INDICATOR and
#   "º" U00BA MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR are legacy characters, superseded by
#   the use of preformatted superscript small letters for ordinal indicators in
#   Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, also supporting plural forms. Consistently
#   French ordinal indicators are preformatted superscripts, too: ᵈ, ᵉ, ʳ, ˢ.
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/2ebe44fd537132620f61830ada804fb7abe1ec6b/common/main/fr.xml#L1546
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/main/fr.xml#L1546
#
#   The two legacy ordinal indicators are supported in group 12 of "^" on key A
#   and in group 12 of "}" on key O.
#   See # # D01 asciicircum
#   See # # D09 braceright
#
#   The following intuitive, case-insensitive, underscore-terminated multikey
#   sequences add to this support in the symbol groups. Underscore termination
#   is consistent with "№" U2116 NUMERO SIGN in the next section. Many fonts
#   give the legacy ordinal indicators a line below, that is not preferred in
#   French and makes "º" U00BA unfit for use in the abbreviation for "numéro".

#
#^# Abbreviations, Units and Legal Symbols
#
#   Sequences for "©" U00A9 and "®" U00AE made out of letters only with an "O"
#   or an "o" are based on en_US.UTF-8/Compose, where "℗" U2117 is missing, as
#   ASCII fallback sequences « ¦(C) » and « ¦(R) », probably because the latter
#   would conflict with "Ȓ" U0212. To mitigate these gaps, an alternative with
#   a pair of leading parentheses is proposed consistently: « ¦()C », « ¦()R »,
#   « ¦()P ».
#
#   Order may matter as for "©" U00A9 COPYRIGHT SIGN by « ¦oc » or « ¦Oc », as
#   opposed to "℅" U2105 CARE OF by « ¦co », « ¦Co », « ¦CO » or « ¦cO ».
#
#   Case may matter as for "⅍" U214D AKTIESELSKAB vs "℁" U2101 ADDRESSED TO THE
#   SUBJECT, or for "🄯" U1F12F COPYLEFT SYMBOL vs "℄" U2104 CENTRE LINE SYMBOL.
#
#   Reverse sequences cannot be supported either for "⅍" U214D as ¦SA conflicts
#   with "ر.س" Saudi Riyal by ¦SAR, and with "♐" U2650 SAGITTARIUS by ¦SAGI.
#
#   Many abbreviations allow for a shortcut skipping the slash, but in the case
#   of "℆" U2106, this shortcut requires space termination to prevent conflicts
#   with an input method for the union symbol "∪" U222A based on its nickname.
#
#   « ¦SO » sequences are used fo mathematical symbols, reverse sequences are
#   used for circled letters, other casing pairs are used for German eszett and
#   for the section sign: "§" U00A7 by « ¦sS », as opposed to "ß" U00DF by
#   « ¦ss » or « ¦sz », and "ẞ" U1E9E by « ¦SS » or « ¦Ss ».
#
#   Title case and camel case sequences are also supported; en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#   supports mixed-case sequences as well. E.g. for the Numero sign "№" U2116,
#   it has <Multi_key><N><o> and <Multi_key><N><O>; adding the other two makes
#   for lenient Caps Lock. A trailing underscore however is added consistently
#   with the glyph and with the legacy ordinal indicators "ª" U00AA, "º" U00BA,
#   so as to prevent a conflict with "⊽" U22BD by « ¦NOR ».
#   See #^# Legacy ordinal indicators
#
#   "¦" U00A6 by « ¦|: » or « ¦:| » is discarded due to conflicts with
#   DIAERESIS&MACRON multikey equivalents.
#
#   Precomposed ("℃" U2103, "℉" U2109, "Å" U212B) and dedicated ("K" U212A)
#   measurement unit symbols are supported for bsing in the Letterlike Symbols
#   block. This however was not fully supported before v1.6.0. Prior to v1.6.0,
#   important symbols were missing due to not being used in mathematics. This
#   odd time is over since version 1.6.0 added primarily the VERSICLE and
#   RESPONSE symbols "℣" U2123, "℟" U211F, both by multikey and in letter
#   groups 1 and 4.

#   Some of these letters are easier input using groups.

#   Conflicting sequences, e.g. with ISO currency codes,
#   are fixed by space termination.
#
#   Titlecase sequences are supported following en_US.UTF-8/Compose, but
#   reverse sequences are not supported since they would not make much sense
#   and are prone to conflicts.
#
#   Deprecated presentation forms for typographic ligatures are not supported,

#   Sequences for combining diacritical marks start with ampersand because this
#   is no multikey equivalent of any dead key, and because that is consistent

# # Spaces
#
#   All important space characters are supported on live keys, as the only
#   acceptable scheme from a user experience point of view. For no-break space
#   and no-break thin space, dead key based input methods, including multikey,
#   can hardly be considered as acceptable workarounds.
#   See # # Automated punctuation spacing for fr-FR, regular with U202F NBTSP
#
#   U00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE is supported in en_US.UTF-8/Compose (by « ¦␣␣ »). But
#   the equally or even more useful U202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE is not. Since
#   both are heavily used in French and consistently supported on live keys,
#   and moreover, the multikey sequence for U00A0 <Multi_key><space><space>
#   conflicts with every single math symbol sequence disambiguated by multiple
#   leading space, sideways compatible support for U00A0 by multikey needs to
#   be dropped as impossible.
#
#   U2008 PUNCTUATION SPACE is supported in en_US.UTF-8/Compose (by « ¦␣. »),
#   but the matching U2007 FIGURE SPACE, that is used with the same rationale
#   in typesetting old-style tables, is not, although the latter is particular
#   in that it is an outstandig reminder that all spaces U2002..U200A were
#   initially designed to be no-break. As <Multi_key><space><period> conflicts
#   with "⩑" U2A51, and disambiguating this would screw it up (by requiring a
#   double leading space), it is discarded, and support for spaces by dead keys
#   is moved to the space groups altogether.

#
#   As a result, U2014 is moved to the new sequence below, that is the most

#
#   U2010 is not mapped on live key, nor in group 1 of HYPHEN-MINUS, given that
#   its correct representation is the ASCII hyphen U002D. Assigning it an extra
#   scalar has mainly had the adverse effect of fooling two font designers into
#   giving U002D a hybrid glyph, fitting neither the expectations for a hyphen,
#   nor those for a minus sign, fully expressing its genericity, pointed out in
#   the Code Chart: “used generically for hyphen, minus sign or en dash, all of
#   which have dedicated alternatives”. The disconnect is in “all of which”.
#
#   U002D HYPHEN-MINUS is the only ASCII punctuation whose usage is discouraged
#   in currrent writing. So, U2010 appears to be a duplicate encoding of U002D,
#   as shown in the Unicode Character Database (shortened):
#
#       <char cp="002D" age="1.1" na="HYPHEN-MINUS" gc="Pd" ea="Na" lb="HY" SB="SC" blk="ASCII"/>
#       <char cp="2010" age="1.1" na="HYPHEN"       gc="Pd" ea="A"  lb="BA" SB="XX" blk="Punctuation"/>
#
#   Noticeable differences are in East Asian width, in the line break class and
#   in the sentence break property.
#
#   The Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm UAX #14 does not require an extra
#   hyphen for non-numerical contexts, and HY is BA (break after).
#   https://unicode.org/reports/tr14/#HY
#
#   East Asian width neither warrants a duplicate hyphen, since Unicode
#   includes UFF0D FULLWIDTH HYPHEN-MINUS, and HYPHEN as “ambiguous” resolves
#   to narrow.
#
#   As of text segmentation, HYPHEN is unspecified, rather than SContinue like
#   HYPHEN-MINUS, and the relevant specification skips “XX” entirely.
#   https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#SContinue
#
#   Bottom line: U2010 is a useless duplicate of U002D and should be prevented
#   from fully deploying its adverse effects by taking up a live key position,
#   or even only an easy-access dead key input method like in group 1 of U002D.
#   (Ultimately, however, U2010 is in group 12 of U002D. And it may be input
#   using the following mnemonic scheme.)
#   See # # C05 minus
#
#   Else, U2010 would screw everything up, from undeliverable email to broken
#   links to parse errors.
#
#   The reason why Unicode, well aware of the duplicate encoding pitfalls, and
#   carefully avoiding an extra decimal dot, an extra factorial, and an extra
#   punctuation apostrophe, was fooled into double-encoding the hyphen, was the
#   old ISO-8859 misnomer HYPHEN-MINUS, whereas ASCII parenthesized the Minus,
#   just like it parenthesized the Decimal Point.
#   https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub1-2-1977.pdf#page=12
#
#   Calling U002D "HYPHEN-MINUS" was like calling U002A *ASTERISK-MULTIPLY, and
#   U002F *SOLIDUS-DIVIDE. Only the MINUS was appended with a hyphen, prompting
#   people to figure out a non-existing reason behind, and to guess that this
#   HYPHEN-MINUS might eventually not be a genuine hyphen. Yet it is, and it is
#   repurposed in programming like so many other symbols. That is most probably
#   how Unicode was fooled into encoding an extra hyphen, not noticing that the
#   hyphen is already there.
#
#   As a consequence, we must stop taking the extra hyphen U2010 seriously, in
#   order to prevent adverse effects on keyboard layout design while attempting
#   to support U2010 on live key or by premium dead key.
#   See # # C05 minus
#
#   The dashes based on multiples of the em dash make up 7 out of 10 dashes and
#   hyphens supported by this digit-based multikey scheme:
#
#       HYPHEN-MINUS   = quarter-dash (French “tiret quart-de-cadratin”)
#       HYPHEN         = quarter-dash (French “tiret quart-de-cadratin”)
#       EN DASH        = half dash (French “tiret demi-cadratin”)
#       HORIZONTAL BAR = three-quarter-dash (in Cambria; or conjoining em dash)
#       EM DASH        = full dash (French “tiret cadratin”)
#       TWO-EM DASH    = indicates missing letters, or a missing word
#       THREE-EM DASH  = used for a missing word, or author’s name repetition

#^# Zhuang tone letters
#
#   Zhuang tone letters are casing and thus require sequences with letters,
#   most appropriately with Z avoiding conflicts with tone bars, paired with
#   the digit both ways for ease of input. Zhuang tone one is unwritten.

#^# Bracketing tone marks
#
#   The tone height is denoted by a leading initialism, localized in French and
#   in English and case insensitive except the English sequence for "˼" U02FC,
#   because with a capital L, this would conflict with "⊾" U22BE. The start or
#   end semantics is carried by a trailing parenthesis: « ¦h( », « ¦H( »,
#   « ¦b( », « ¦B( », « ¦l( », « ¦L( », or « ¦h) », « ¦H) », « ¦b) », « ¦B) »,
#   « ¦l) ».
#
#   "꜠" UA720 and "꜡" UA721 are supported alongside, as these are ligatures of
#   begin tone marks and stress, adding a median apostrophe to the sequences,
#   with alias sequences featuring rightsinglequotemark instead.

#   support for vulgar fractions needed to be reimplemented.
#
#   Consistently with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, 2-digit sequences support the
#   fractions as more frequently used than circled digits, but ⅒ is now
#   <Multi_key><1><1>, not <Multi_key><1><1><0>.
#
#   For a predictable, intuitive, consistent, versatile user experience,
#   sequences with a slash are also supported, and fraction numerator 1,
#   initially <Multi_key><1><slash>, is extended with space accordingly,
#   while its short sequence <Multi_key><1><space> is still supported.
#
#   Freely composed vulgar fractions may use "⁄" U2044 FRACTION SLASH.
#   The fraction slash triggers autoformatting of base digits to vulgar
#   fractions in Unicode-conformant rendering engines like HarfBuzz.
#   See # # Fraction slash
#   See dispocla.cpp key <AC04>
#
#   A workaround for defective renderers is using superscript digits for
#   numerators, and subscript digits for denominators, with the negative
#   kerning around FRACTION SLASH independently of OpenType support. The
#   result is acceptable if super- and subscripts align between baseline
#   and caps height.

# # Degree sign
#
#   "°" U00B0 is on live key E11, on level 2 consistently with French AZERTY,
#   and on level 5 as part of the graphics-only, extended AltFr-level numpad on
#   the alphanumeric block.
#
#   By contrast, the degree sign’s legacy multikey sequence <Multi_key><o><o>
#   as in en_US.UTF-8/Compose cannot be supported, since it is required for "ꝏ"
#   UA74F LATIN SMALL LETTER OO. To compensate this loss, "°" U00B0 has support
#   in dead_abovering on the pattern <Multi_key><asterisk><0> with the dead key

#
#^# Bullets
#
#   In keysymdef.h, 15 bullets are supported, but some comments do not match.
#   This supports the bullets as implemented and adds support for the intended
#   open rectangular bullet "▭" U25AD.
#
#   Default HTML/CSS bullets have equivalents in Unicode as "•" U2022 for the
#   first level and "◦" U25E6 for the second level. For level 3, "▪" U25AA is
#   sometimes chosen in an attempt to stick with `list-style-type: square`, but
#   this is an emoji. That is why as a level 3 bullet, "‣" U2023 may eventually
#   be an interesting alternative. These are in groups 1..3 of underscore, too.
#   See # # C07 underscore
#
#   Some sequences based on English mnemonic have French equivalents.
#
#   "∎" U220E has bilingual support in the math symbols.
#   See # # Mathematical Operators of block U2200
#
#   These sequences are case insensitive in that they can be typed either in
#   lowercase or in uppercase (but neither in titlecase nor in mixed case).

#^# Currency symbols
#
#   Symbol-letter sequences are used as multikey equivalents of dead keys, and
#   equal in particular is used for regional indicator letters, so only letter-
#   symbol sequences are available for currency symbols by multikey.
#   See #*# CURRENCY
#
#   These are symbols supported in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, including commented-out
#   ones completed on a best-guess basis.
#   But unlike set up in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, <Multi_key><C><bar> is "₵" U20B5.
#   And "¢" U00A2 is <Multi_key><bar><c> only, due to conflicts with "ȼ" U023C,
#   "⊄" U2284 and "⊈" U2288.
#   See #*# CURRENCY
#   See #*# MACRON
#   See #*# STROKE
#
#   The generic currency symbol "¤" U00A4 is supported by case insensitive X O
#   sequences. Reverse sequences conflict with mathematical symbols.

#   This only supports non-trivial symbols. Dollar sign and results made of
#   sequences including Latin base letters and punctuation are commented out,
#   as several of these conflict with legal symbols "™" by « ¦tm », "℅" by
#   « ¦co », or with letters.
#
#   Pound sign is commented out too as conflicting and easy to input on live
#   keys.

#   Input sequences are based on Latin names and on French names and mostly are
#   four characters long, for conflictless consistency.
#
#   Base 16 numeric sequences are also supported, not conflicting with vulgar

#   for intuitivity. These are terminated by asterisk, not started, avoiding

#^# Circle quadrants

#   Half circles are supported in mathematical symbols.

#   The leading letter prevents a conflict with "↉" U2189 and is case sensitive
#   in that it is a small q for empty quadrants, a capital Q for filled ones.

#   a dead_circumflex multikey equivalent with digit 3 as the base character:

#   heart emoji, which is part of the suit series U2660..U2667: "♥" U2665 BLACK

# # Symbols for multikey and composition
#
#   The ISO/IEC 9995-7 symbol "⎄" U2384 is supported by case insensitive
#   « ¦cmp ». Not « ¦com », to prevent conflicts with "℅" U2105.
#
#   The broken bar "¦" U00A6, repurposed as multikey symbol, is input by case
#   insensitive « ¦mul ».
#
#   "¦" U00A6 is also in group 12 of bar, in dead_macron "5", and in
#   dead_diaeresis backslash.
#   See # # C10 bar
#   See #*# MACRON
#   See #*# DIAERESIS
#
#   The rationale for providing an alternative "¦" U00A6 to the "⎄" U2384 ISO
#   symbol is font support and a slimmer, less bulky, visually less impacting,
#   less outstanding glyph design in documentation, since the ISO symbol did
#   not make it onto many keyboards, partly because dedicating an entire key
#   to input composition rather than a mere key position, possibly on level 3,
#   is not recommended in the presence of a group dead key providing a more
#   powerful input method for current digraphs.
#
#   Downgrading the composition symbol from "⎄" U2384 to "¦" U00A6 as a result
#   stands for a less screwed-up user experience.

### Mathematical symbols by multikey
#
#
#   The General Category `Symbol, other` (`So`) does not preclude a symbol from
#   being a math symbol, despite there is the dedicated `Symbol, math` (`Sm`).
#   Indeed both `Sm` and `So` are only informative, not normative.
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/UnicodeStandard-15.0.pdf#page=199
#
#   The reason why is that labeling all math symbols as `Sm` is not feasible,
#   and it is not advisable either, since mathematics repurposed many symbols
#   intrinsically extraneous to mathematics, such as the male and female signs,
#   already supercharged as planet symbols ("♀" U2640, "♂" U2642), three music
#   symbols, one of which is `Sm` ("♯" U266F, and `So` "♭" U266D, "♮" U266E),
#   and the first four suits, regardless whether filled or empty ("♠" U2660,
#   "♡" U2661, "♢" U2662, "♣" U2663), but not the last four.
#
#   The derived Unicode property `Math` in turn still only defines a subset of
#   the symbols that need to be supported as math symbols.
#   https://www.unicode.org/Public/15.0.0/ucd/DerivedCoreProperties.txt
#
#   E.g. "⭅" U2B45 and "⭆" U2B46 are not labeled as `Math`, yet both are found
#   in TeX math packages and are thus expected to be supported by input methods
#   consistently.

# # Design of math sequences
#
#   For a conflictless support of variable length sequences, space termination
#   is required for math symbols, except for longest sequences. Both the ASCII
#   space and the no-break space are supported as terminating space, the ASCII
#   space because in French mode, it is mapped on level 3, in synergy with the
#   ASCII symbols that are likely to occur at the end of math symbol Multi_key
#   sequences.
#
#   When things do not work as expected, the likely culprit is a conflict with
#   a dead key equivalent, or with another math sequence. To fix these issues,
#   sequences may start with a space or interchangeably with a no-break space.
#   No-break space in this position is supported for the sake of synergy with
#   the Multi_key dead key, mapped invariably on level 3 both in French mode,
#   when it is on key E12, and in ASCII mode, when it is also on key D12; yet
#   the space character in synergy with Multi_key is no-break space in French
#   mode, ASCII space in ASCII mode.
#
#   Examples: "≪" U226A and "≫" U226B, "⋘" U22D8 and "⋙" U22D9.
#
#   Leading space is also used to disambiguate math sequences from each other
#   in case intuitivity requires similar sequences for different symbols. This
#   may require prepending multiple spaces. In case of multiple leading spaces,
#   the thumb may be lifted from the level 3 modifier after any of them, also
#   in French mode, requiring alias sequences with leading no-break spaces.
#
#   Examples involving single or multiple leading [nobreak]space:
#   Single:    "∕" U2215, "∖" U2216, "∣" U2223, "∼" U223C;
#   Double:    "⧸" U29F8, "⧂" U29C2, "⧜" U29DC, "◽" U25FD, "⤶" U2936;
#   Triple:    "⟋" U27CB and "⟍" U27CD;
#   Quadruple:  "⁄" U2044 and "⧵" U29F5.
#
#   To prevent further conflicts with dead key equivalents, negated sequences
#   work the other way around: letters first, slash last, except when required
#   otherwise to disambiguate partial negations, as in "≇" U2247 vs "≆" U2246.
#
#   Examples: "∄" U2204, "∅" U2205, "∉" U2209.
#
#   For opposite or reverse relationships, when the symbol is turned, flipped
#   horizontally or vertically, a matching alternate slug is used, as well as
#   a trailing percent sign or a trailing backslash with dead key semantics,
#   so as to provide both a streamlined and an intuitive input method. Most
#   slugs use graphic mnemonic, while H and CP use alphabetic mnemonic based
#   on HARP or on COPRODUCT.
#
#   Symbol A   Slug |  Symbol B   Slug  Alternative with trailing transform
#   "∈" U2208  e    |  "∋" U220B  p     e\

#   The sequences of symbols with less or equal, greater or equal semantics are
#   redesigned compared to those used in en_US.UTF-8/Compose. Trying to support
#   both the straight variant "≤" U2264, "≥" U2265, and the slanted variant "⩽"
#   U2A7D, "⩾" U2A7E, sequences with underscore are repurposed, and sequences
#   with minus are introduced, since those with equals are needed for "≦" U2266
#   "≧" U2267, and other symbols with “or equal to” semantics. For double-line
#   equals, sequences with equals sign are used; for single-line equals, ASCII
#   minus is used; for slanted equals, underscore is used, a single underscore
#   for single-line equals, two underscores for double-line equals.
#
#   Examples: "⪛" U2A9B, "⋚" U22DA, "⪋" U2A8B.
#
#   For consistency, multikey sequences starting with slash, pipe, or backslash
#   followed by a trailing digit are in the corresponding dead keys, where they
#   are not space terminated.

#   Sequences including quotedbl need to be replicated using EuroSign instead,
#   since the euro sign replaces quotedbl on AltGr/Option + E.
#
#   Sequences including semicolon need to be replicated using section instead,
#   since the section sign replaces the semicolon in French mode.
#
#   As rightsinglequotemark is on the apostrophe key in French mode, sequences
#   with apostrophe work also with rightsinglequotemark, although apostrophe is

#   On complete layouts, "⁄" U2044 FRACTION SLASH is on live keys:
#   C01, level 6, and B09, level 7, in ASCII mode also on level 6.
#   See # # Vulgar fractions
#
#   Also in dead_stroke followed by 4, without space termination.

#
#   Additionally, "⁄" U2044 FRACTION SLASH is supported by multikey the same
#   way as "⧵" U29F5 REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR, for completeness.

#   of ampersand in this context.

#   Other alphanumeric mathematical symbols are supported in groups 6 to 10,
#   including some of these that have extra signatures here for convenience.
#   The liter symbol "ℓ" U2113 goes extra, "𝓁" U1D4C1 is encoded separately.
#   Space termination is skipped where obviously dispensable.

#   "⧵" U29F5 REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR is likely a duplicate of "∖" U2216 SET
#   MINUS with the potential to fool people into decisions causing issues, e.g.
#   “\setminus translated as U29F5 ⧵ REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR causes problems”
#   https://github.com/tudace/tuda_latex_templates/issues/409
#
#   Consistently, "⧵" U29F5 goes unmentioned in TUS, Table 22-5. Mathematical
#   Operators Disunified from Punctuation, as disunifying this from "\" U005C
#   was pointless. As a consequence, people are left stranded when attempting
#   to make sense of this code point.
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/UnicodeStandard-15.0.pdf#page=903&zoom=100,0,500
#
#   Fonts may give the duplicate a slight difference in slant. One example is
#   DejaVu Sans Mono Book.
#
#   "∕" U2215 DIVISION SLASH, by contrast, does not have any *SOLIDUS OPERATOR
#   equivalent. Therefore, U29F5 is disambiguated by a quadruple leading space.
#   For convenience, these [back]slash symbols are alternatively disambiguated
#   by a trailing digit, also those with a single leading space for consistency
#   in the related dead key (without space termination).

#   The vector cross product symbol "⨯" U2A2F is confusable with the Latin-1
#   multiplication symbol "×" U00D7 and is probably another duplicate encoding,
#   since the vector dot product symbol is the dot operator "⋅" U22C5.
#
#   Consistently, TUS does not mention mathematical operators disunified from
#   Latin-1 operators, along the lines of Table 22-5. Mathematical Operators
#   Disunified from Punctuation, as disunifying "⨯" U2A2F from "×" U00D7 was
#   pointless. As a consequence, people are left stranded when attempting to
#   make sense of this code point.

# # LaTeX codes
#
#   Since the maximum number of keysyms is 9, many LaTeX commands need to be
#   truncated to make working multikey sequences out of them, limiting this
#   input method’s usability.
#
#   Most short sequences require space termination for disambiguation. This
#   is also consistent with TeX control words.
