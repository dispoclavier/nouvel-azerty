#
#               Installation: On a shared computer please opt for method C.
#                             If other keyboard layouts are used alongside, please apply method A.
#                             Method B requires the least compile time when opening applications.
#                             Including this file in another file in X11/locale/ does not work.
#                             Prepending rather than appending does not work because U1E7A and U1E7B
#                             need to override U01D5 and U01D6. Likewise, "V́" and "v́" need to override
#                             U01D7 and U01D8 as defined in en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#                             Please do not use this file but the full file `Compose.yml`.
#
#                             A. 1. Back up the file /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#                                2. Append `Compose.yml` to /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#                             B. 1. Back up the file /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#                                2. Replace /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose with `Compose.yml`.
#                             C. 1. Back up the file ~/.XCompose if it exists.
#                                2. Append `Compose.yml` to ~/.XCompose or rename it accordingly.
#                                3. Optionally uncomment the following line:
#                                       include "%L"
#                                   That is not mandatory since this file is designed to be standalone.

### Output strings for live keys
#
#   Unlike Windows, XCompose is able to output >1 code units by dead keys.
#   It also handles the output of strings after a single live key press,
#       https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ComposeKey#Compose_key
#       https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/man5/Compose.5.html
#       https://wiki.debian.org/XCompose
#   provided that the X Input Method is active.
#       https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xkeyboard-config/+bug/1584314/comments/6
#       http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man8/im-config.8.html
#       https://askubuntu.com/questions/129680/how-can-i-make-ibus-not-ignore-xcompose
#
#   In XCompose, a single keysym hapax is processed for direct output, whereas a keysym
#   followed by another keysym in >0 instances is considered a dead key throughout, and
#   its singleton output is discarded, thus the system “eats” the dead key press if the
#   input sequence is undefined.
#
#   Definition format in XCompose files:
#   * Single character output may be defined like in allocation tables,
#     but this format is reportedly not interoperable across XKB.
#   * Strings must be defined as literals delimited by double quotes.
#     This is the interoperable format for single character output.
#   Both formats may be used concurrently.
#
#   Definition format in allocation tables (Symbols directory):
#   Single character output in any UCS plane may be defined in:
#   * Uxxxx[x[x]] hex format;
#   * U00xxxxxx hex format;
#   * 0x01xxxxxx hex format.
#   The specified format "\0x123A" does *not* work, neither with nor without quotes,
#   with nor without backslash. Therefore the following specification is not reliable:
#   https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.html
#
#   These layouts make extensive use of added keysyms as in keysymdef.h:97.

#
# # Breton polygraphs
#
#   The Breton polygraphs are mapped as such on the CʼHWERTY keyboard following
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19506.
#
#   Following the link chain from the documentation of the CʼHWERTY keyboard:
#   http://www.drouizig.org/index.php/br/binviou-br/klavier-c-hwerty-ha-sturiou/162-faq-foire-aux-questions
#   https://dominiko.livejournal.com/22848.html
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25349
#
#   The Breton trigraph has a dedicated key on the Breton variant "kbbrFRs" and
#   it is supported on Shift + AltFr + A on the French base layout "kbfrFRs".
#
#   The Breton trigraph uses regular letter apostrophe U02BC.
#   See Breton exemplar characters in CLDR as pointed in:
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19506#c16.
#   CLDR versions below v34 are too incomplete:
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/release-34/common/main/br.xml#L1164
#
#   These have got mnemonic keysyms in keysymdef.h but may not be supported yet,
#   so they are defined here using "ʼ" U02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE:
#
<c_h> : "cʼh"
<C_h> : "Cʼh"
<C_H> : "CʼH"
#
#
#   The Breton digraph is mapped on the CʼHWERTY keyboard.
#   Therefore, in XKB, it has got three keysyms, too.
#
#   Unlike the trigraph, the digraph has no dedicated support on any variant.
#   It is expected to be input like all polygraphs, as used in many languages.
#

<Ch> : "Ch"

# # Automated punctuation spacing for fr-FR, regular with NNBSP U202F
#
#   Imprimerie nationale (France) assumes that big punctuation is spaced out using either
#   of these spaces:
#
#       * No-break justifying space, behaving like Unicode’s NBSP U00A0;
#       * No-break thin space, behaving like Unicode’s NNBSP U202F.
#
#   Functionally, NNBSP is a no-break clone of Unicode’s thin space THSP U2009.
#
#   The preferred name and abbreviation of U2009 are NARROW SPACE, NSP.
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/tools/cldr-code/src/main/java/org/unicode/cldr/util/CodePointEscaper.java
#
#   This is regular typesetting at Imprimerie nationale except for colon and quotation marks,
#   although the latter are typeset with NNBSP in the Imprimerie nationale style guide
#   (_Lexique des règles en usage à l’Imprimerie nationale_, Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 2002);
#   only the verbatim rule on page 149 disagrees.
#   In mainstream high-quality publishing (new school), NNBSP is used throughout.
#
#   See Philippe Verdy’s testimony:
#   http://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2015-m06/0220.html
#
#   Unicode was supposed to encode SI/BIPM number typesetting as well as French
#   punctuation typesetting, and for that purpose encoded THIN SPACE along with
#   all other typographic space characters in the range U+2000..U+200A, and for
#   that purpose designed the line breaking property as no-break for all spaces
#   starting with U+2002, with the widest spaces both in a breaking variant and
#   a no-break variant (U+2000, U+2001 vs U+2002, U+2003). But that design goal
#   was compromised, leaving as no-break only U+2007 FIGURE SPACE, which is the
#   single least useful space to be no-break since it only occurs inside tables
#   for the purpose of indenting by the width of a digit, alongside U+2008 that
#   indents by the width of a decimal dot or comma, and never in flowing text.

#   The Unicode Standard, version 7.0.0, 2014, p. 265, chapter 6, section 6.2,
#   heading “Space Characters”, subheading “Narrow No-Break Space”. Currently:
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/ch06.pdf#G1834
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/ch06.pdf#page=13&zoom=100,0,300
#
#      The NNBSP can be used to represent the narrow space occurring around punctuation
#      characters in French typography, which is called an “espace fine insécable.”
#
#   Unicode® Standard Annex #14, Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm, Unicode 15.1.0:
#   https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-51.html#NNBSPdoc
#
#      When NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE occurs in French text, it should be interpreted
#      as an “espace fine insécable”.
#
#   The Unicode position reflects also in the following document:
#   Recommendations to UTC #160 July 2019 on Script Proposals — Script Ad Hoc group
#   http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19286-script-recs.pdf
#   Page 14 (last page) states:
#
#      The Unicode Standard includes several different space characters.
#      It is acceptable to use THIN SPACE, and then use a higher-level protocol,
#      a word joiner, or tailored line-breaking to prevent line-breaking.
#      Alternatively, NNBSP can be used to force no-break behavior.
#
#   However, higher level protocols and tailoring are inacceptable options when
#   used to achieve the digital representation of natural languages. The Unicode
#   Standard specifies that it is about plain text.
#
#   In Unicode CLDR, French migrated from NBSP to NNBSP for grouping digits and
#   in short measurement unit patterns, in v34, released on 2018-10-15:
#   https://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-34
#
#      The French locale now uses narrow no-break space U+202F is several places:
#      as the numeric grouping separator, in many short unit patterns, and in
#      the locale display name patterns. It also changed normal space to
#      no-break space U+00A0 in the wide unit patterns.
#
#      Migration
#
#      French grouping separator changed from no-break space U+00A0 to
#      narrow no-break space U+202F.

#   (last edition as per 2017 reprint), angle quotation marks are typeset with a narrow
#   space, which corresponds to NNBSP, not a word space, which would correspond to NBSP.
#
#   Once some “dysfunctional” keyboard layout variants supported some of these.
#   Now none of these are supported anymore.

### Multi_key sequences
#
#   The described behavior of XCompose is based on en_US.UTF-8/Compose,
#   as it is used in France.
#
#   The maximum number of keysyms is nine. Longer sequences are ignored.
#
#
# # Notes for maintenance
#
#   The colon alignment in column 100 is based on longest Multi_key sequences
#   in terms of string length, as used for U10789, U107AB.
#
#   The Multi_key equivalent is added below each dead key sequence by a script
#   called `generate-multikey.pl`, run by `multikey.sh`, if the sequence is
#   marked up accordingly. For portability, Multi_key equivalents are present
#   regardless whether they make sense, and whether they barely work.
#
#   Three Multi_key sequences do not work because <numbersign> is used both as
#   a group selector and as a base character:
#   <Multi_key><numbersign>                        <numbersign> : "☐" U2610 # BALLOT BOX
#   <Multi_key><numbersign><numbersign>            <numbersign> : "☑" U2611 # BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK emoji
#   <Multi_key><numbersign><numbersign><numbersign><numbersign> : "☒" U2612 # BALLOT BOX WITH X
#   With respect to dead key use, these topmost sequences are maintained, but
#   related Multi_key equivalents are actionable only in groups 5 through 7.
#   See # # C01
#
#   Three other Multi_key sequences do not work due to conflicts with many math
#   symbols, but that does not matter since these sequences are pointless:
#   <Multi_key><apostrophe><minus> : "‐" U2010 # HYPHEN
#   <Multi_key><colon><minus>      : "‑" U2011 # NON-BREAKING HYPHEN
#   <Multi_key><less><period>      : "‌" U200C # ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
#   These sequences are due to shortcuts by diacritical dead keys.
#   See #*# ACUTE
#   See #*# DIAERESIS
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   Two Multi_key sequences have duplicates by design:
#   <Multi_key><less><3> : "❤" U2764 # HEAVY BLACK HEART red emoji, most-used in France
#   <Multi_key><less><8> : "♥" U2665 # BLACK HEART SUIT red emoji, 14th-ranking
#   First instances:  See #   Heart emoji
#   Second instances: See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#
#*# COMPOSE
#   Multi_key
#   Dchar: "¦" U00A6
#
# # Circled by leading o
#
#   This only supports numbers 1–10, since letters would conflict with œ, ꝏ, ©.
#   Other conflicts affect "⫯" U2AEF. Consistently, this way,
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose supports only Ⓐ.
#   See #*# GREEK
#   See #^# CIRCLED
#
#   The o is case insensitive.

# # Dashes and hyphens
#
#   U2010 is not mapped on live key, given that its standard representation is
#   the ASCII hyphen U002D. Assigning it an extra scalar potentially fools font
#   designers into giving U002D a hybrid glyph fitting neither the expectations
#   for a hyphen nor those for a minus sign, fully expressing its genericity as
#   pointed in the Unicode Code Chart: “used generically for hyphen, minus sign
#   or en dash, all of which have dedicated alternatives”. As a consequence, it
#   should be prevented from fully deploying its adverse effects by taking up a
#   position on keyboard layouts, screwing everything up in the process, from
#   undeliverable email to broken links to parse errors. It may be input using
#   the group selector dead key like double and triple dashes, or the following
#   mnemonic scheme. "‑" U2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN is also in group 1 of equal.
#   See # # Long dashes
#
#       HYPHEN         = quarter-dash (French “tiret quart-de-cadratin”)
#       EN DASH        = half a dash (French “tiret demi-cadratin”)
#       HORIZONTAL BAR = three-quarter-dash in Cambria, or conjoining em dash
#       EM DASH        = full dash (French “tiret cadratin”)
#       TWO-EM DASH    = indicates missing letters, or a missing word
#       THREE-EM DASH  = used for a missing word, or author’s name repetition
#
#   About the latter two, see https://jkorpela.fi/dashes.html

# # Vulgar fractions
#
#   Since the design of this file was changed to become standalone,
#   support for vulgar fractions needed to be reimplemented.
#
#   Consistently with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, 2-digit sequences support the
#   fractions as more frequently used than circled digits, but ⅒ is now
#   <Multi_key><1><1>, not <Multi_key><1><1><0>.
#
#   For a predictable, intuitive, consistent, versatile user experience,
#   sequences with a slash are also supported, and fraction numerator 1,
#   initially <Multi_key><1><slash>, is extended with space accordingly,
#   while its short sequence <Multi_key><1><space> is still supported.
#
#   Freely composed vulgar fractions may use ⁄ U2044 FRACTION SLASH, that
#   triggers autoformatting of base digits to vulgar fractions as stated
#   in the Unicode Standard — on the condition that the rendering engine
#   is actually Unicode conformant, like HarfBuzz (OpenType) in Firefox.
#   See # # Fraction slash
#
#   A workaround for defective renderers is using superscript digits for
#   numerators, and subscript digits for denominators, with the negative
#   kerning around FRACTION SLASH independently of OpenType support. The
#   result is acceptable if super- and subscripts align between baseline
#   and caps height.

# # Bullets
#
#   In keysymdef.h, 15 bullets are supported, but some comments do not match.
#   This supports the keysyms as implemented, adding support for the intended
#   open rectangular bullet, evidently wrong since the output is filled. This
#   literal is removed for demo on systems working without literals; since it
#   outputs an unintended character, it could be downright discarded as well.
#   Japanese tainome and kome are also supported.

# # Currency symbols
#
#   Symbol-letter sequences are required for precomposed diacritics, with
#   EQUALS SIGN used for regional indicator letters, so only letter-symbol
#   is available for currency symbols.
#
#   These are symbols supported by en_US.UTF-8/Compose, including commented-out
#   ones completed on a best-guess basis.
#   But unlike set up in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, <Multi_key><C><bar> is "₵" U20B5.
#   See #*# CURRENCY
#   And "¢" U00A2 is <Multi_key><bar><c> only, due to conflicts with "ȼ" U023C,
#   "⊄" U2284 and "⊈" U2288.
#   See #*# STROKE
#   See #*# CURRENCY
#
#   The generic currency symbol `¤` U00A4 is supported by case insensitive X O
#   sequences. Reverse sequences conflict with mathematical symbols.

#   Heart emoji
#
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose supports only the least frequent BMP heart emoji, which
#   is part of the suit series, U2660..U2667: "♥" U2665 BLACK HEART SUIT, while
#   "❤" U2764 HEAVY BLACK HEART is the most used emoji in France. Consistently,
#   this is given the traditional sequence. The other heart is disambiguated by
#   leading space like math symbols, and it is given an alternative shape-based
#   sequence as well.
#
#   For consistency, two of these sequences are duplicated in dead_circumflex.

#
# # Design of math sequences
#
#   For a conflictless support of variable length sequences, space termination
#   is required for math symbols, except for longest sequences. Both the ASCII
#   space and the no-break space, on level 3 on the spacebar, are supported as
#   terminating space.
#
#   When things do not work as expected, the likely culprit is a conflict with
#   a dead key equivalent. To fix these issues, sequences may start with space
#   or with no-break space. No-break space instead of space is supported for a
#   better synergy with the Multi_key dead key, on level 3 across modes, while
#   the space character in synergy with Multi_key is no-break space in French
#   mode, ASCII space in ASCII mode, i.e. when ModLock is on.
#   Examples: "≪" U226A and "≫" U226B, "⋘" U22D8 and "⋙" U22D9.
#
#   Leading space is also used to disambiguate math sequences from each other
#   in case intuitivity requires similar sequences for different symbols. This
#   may require prepending multiple spaces. In case of multiple leading spaces,
#   the thumb may be lifted from the level 3 modifier after any of them, also
#   in French mode, i.e. when ModLock is off.
#
#   Examples involving a double, triple, or quadruple leading [nobreak]space:
#   Double:    "⧂" U29C2, "⧜" U29DC, "⧸" U29F8, "◽" U25FD, "⤶" U2936;
#   Triple:    "⟋" U27CB and "⟍" U27CD;
#   Quadruple: "⧵" U29F5, "⁄" U2044.
#
#   To prevent further conflicts with dead key equivalents, negated sequences
#   work the other way around: letters first, slash last, space to terminate,
#   except when required otherwise for disambiguation in partial negation, as
#   in ≇ U2247 vs "≆" U2246. E.g. "∄" U2204, "∅" U2205, "∉" U2209.
#
#   For consistency, Multi_key sequences starting with slash, pipe or backslash
#   followed by a trailing digit are in the corresponding dead keys, where they
#   are not space terminated.
#   Slash: "∕" U2215, "⧸" U29F8, "⟋" U27CB, "⁄" U2044.
#   See #*# #*# STROKE
#   Vertical bar: "⫾" U2AFE, "∣" U2223, "‖" U2016, "⦀" U2980, "∥" U2225,
#   "¦" U00A6, "⫴" U2AF4, "⫿" U2AFF, "⏸" U23F8, "⫼" U2AFC.
#   See #*# MACRON, TOPBAR, LONG_LEG
#   Backslash: "∖" U2216, "⧹" U29F9, "⟍" U27CD, "⧵" U29F5.
#   See #*# #*# REVERSED
#
#
# # Less or equal, greater or equal
#
#   To support both the straight variant "≤" U2264, "≥" U2265, and the slanted
#   variant, sequences with underscore are repurposed, and sequences with minus
#   are introduced since those with equals are needed for "≦" U2266, "≧" U2267.
#   This applies to all symbols with “or equal to” semantics. If the equals is
#   double line, sequences with equals sign are used; if it is single line, the
#   ASCII minus is used; if the equals is slanted, underscore is used, a single
#   underscore for single-line equals, two underscores for double-line equals,
#   e.g. "⪛" U2A9B. See also "⋚" U22DA vs "⪋" U2A8B.
#
#   The slanted variant "⩽" U2A7D and "⩾" U2A7E, preferred in French, is also
#   in group 2 of < and >.
#
#
# # Not sign
#
#   As rightsinglequotemark is on the apostrophe key in French mode, sequences
#   with apostrophe work also with rightsinglequotemark, like sequences with a
#   leading space also work with a leading no-break space.
#
#   The not sign is also in group 5 of backslash on the N key.
#
#   See also "⫬" U2AEC, "⫭" U2AED, and not-math "⌙" U2319.

#   The at sign is used as a modifier in these Multi_key sequences because it
#   is on the same key as dead_greek and is thus its Multi_key equivalent.
#   See #*# GREEK
#
#   There are many more Greek symbols. Some TeX math packages may not support
#   them all, per Will Robertson, Symbols defined by unicode-math (2023-06-21).

#   "⧵" U29F5 REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR: likely duplicate "∖" U2216 SET MINUS with the potential to fool people into decisions causing issues, e.g.
#   “\setminus translated as U+29F5 ⧵ REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR causes problems #409”
#   https://github.com/tudace/tuda_latex_templates/issues/409
#   Fonts, e.g. DejaVu Sans Mono Book, may give them a slight difference in slant.
#   Since "∕" U2215 DIVISION SLASH does not have any *SOLIDUS OPERATOR equivalent, REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR is disambiguated by a quadruple leading space.
#   For convenience these [back]slash symbols are alternatively disambiguated by a trailing digit, for consistency also those with a single leading space.

# # LaTeX codes
#
#   Since the maximum number of keysyms is 9, many LaTeX commands need to be
#   truncated to make working Multi_key sequences out of them, limiting this
#   input method’s usability.
#
#   Most short sequences require space termination for disambiguation. This
#   is also consistent with TeX control words.
