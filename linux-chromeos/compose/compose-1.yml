#
#   * The file name depends on the location and the installation method (A, B or C);
#     in the $HOME/ directory, this is a hidden file named XCompose: ".XCompose";
#     inside the X11/ subdirectory in /usr/share/, this file is named only "Compose",
#     because the context is clear and the file names do not need to be any more specific.
#  ** In Unicode CLDR, this platform is labeled ChromeOS, and it is explained that
#     in the CLDR, Linux is supported alongside ChromeOS, or through ChromeOS.
#
#               Installation: 1. Set the input method to XIM, because other input methods may
#                                not support multi-character output, including composed letters
#                                required for Unicode conformant output on dead keys; with the
#                                input method set to none, this XCompose file is not compiled.
#
#                                The following command activates the X Window Input Method:
#
#                                    im-config -n xim
#
#                                The currently active input method displays on line 2 after:
#
#                                    im-config -m
#
#                                Setting the input method to XIM to begin with is essential,
#                                because some Linux distros may not ship XIM as the default.
#
#                             2. Make sure to be using the full-length file XCompose.yml.
#
#                             3. Proceed following method A, B or C:
#
#                                CAUTION: If the environment variable $XCOMPOSEFILE is set,
#                                         its value is used as the path of the XCompose file.
#                                         In case of success, other XCompose files are not
#                                         compiled unless included as documented below.
#
#                                A. System level:
#                                   1. Back up the XCompose file at the path mapped onto the
#                                      locale in /usr/share/X11/locale/compose.dir; for fr_FR:
#                                      /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#                                   2. Append Compose.yml to the original XCompose file.
#                                      Prepending instead of appending breaks U1E7A and U1E7B,
#                                      that need to override U01D5 and U01D6 as defined in
#                                      en_US.UTF-8/Compose. The same holds true for "V́", "v́"
#                                      overriding en_US.UTF-8/Compose for U01D7 and U01D8.
#
#                                B. User level, with .XCompose in the $HOME/ directory:
#                                   1. Back up the file $HOME/.XCompose.
#                                   2. Append Compose.yml to $HOME/.XCompose.
#
#                                C. User level, without .XCompose in the $HOME/ directory:
#                                   1. Copy Compose.yml to $HOME/.XCompose.
#                                   2. For maximum backward compatibility, uncomment this
#                                      instruction, where "%L" expands to the default XCompose
#                                      file path of the current locale, that for fr_FR is
#                                      /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#
#                                          include "%L"
#
#                                   This is required for using non-Latin keyboard layouts
#                                   with dead keys as supported in en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#                                   Any specific XCompose file can be included by its path,
#                                   where "%S" expands to /usr/share/X11/locale:
#
#                                          include "%S/en_US.UTF-8/Compose"
#
#                             The changes take effect in any application after reopening it,
#                             or after opening a new session if XIM needs to be activated.
#
#             Uninstallation: A, B: Restore the previously backed-up original XCompose file.
#                             C:    Delete or rename the added file $HOME/.XCompose.

#                 Legal note: Despite its name, this file has been developed from scratch
#                             based on the C code of a keyboard layout developed for and on
#                             Windows, and it is not derived from en_US.UTF-8/Compose, nor
#                             from any of the Compose files shipped with Linux. As a result,
#                             it can be released under the Apache 2.0 license, and it can be
#                             transpiled back to C and used as source code for layout drivers

#                               A combination of underengineering and lack of consultancy due
#                               to impiety triggered design mistakes, incrementally fixed in
#                               versions 2..5 as they came up. In the first place the level-3
#                               ASCII map was inadequate by not making room for the euro sign
#                               until v2.0 when it ultimately became practical and respectful
#                               thanks to God helping and advising about the layout details.
#                               The superscripts were at the wrong level, and modifiers for
#                               titlecase polygrams "Cʼh" and "Nᵒ " were unintuitive, due to
#                               not seeking advice from God until ultimately v3.0 came up. A
#                               wrong modifier (AltFr instead of Shift) used for spaced-out
#                               punctuation, with a semblance of logic but without usability,
#                               was due to never asking God which modifier is the correct one
#                               for spaced-out punctuation, until v4.0. And duplicate comma,
#                               duplicate period in ASCII mode on the graphic numpad’s keys
#                               B07 and B08 were due to a desperate attempt to stay backwards
#                               compatible as far as possible, until God helped to notice the
#                               valuable UX improvement due to moving Left Shift closer as of
#                               B07..B10 in ASCII mode compared to French mode, hence v5.0.
#                               Bottomline: Development was delayed since 2016 when a workable
#                               solution was overdue, until 2025 when NF Z71-300 released in
#                               2019-04 was under revision (with a deadline on 2024-07-31),
#                               due to only reluctantly praying God for help and advice, rather
#                               than following the straightforward way roadmapped in the Bible.

### Multicharacter strings for live keys
#
#   Dead key handling XCompose has the ability to output more than one single
#   code unit, outperforming the misdesigned Windows Text Services Framework,
#   that can do so by live keys only, and is limited to 16 UTF-16 code units,
#   and even to only 4 code units on Shift + Ctrl + Alt (modifier byte 0x07),
#   as opposed to XCompose, that does not impose any upper limit on the result
#   string length, and also handles multicharacter output on single live key
#   press.
#   https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.xhtml
#   https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.html

#   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ComposeKey#Compose_key
#   https://wiki.debian.org/XCompose
#   https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/libx11-doc/XCompose.3.en.html
#
#   However, for the multicharacter feature to be effective and actually work,
#   activating the X Window Input Method, XIM for short, is mandatory.
#   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xkeyboard-config/+bug/1584314/comments/6
#   http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man8/im-config.8.html
#   https://askubuntu.com/questions/129680/how-can-i-make-ibus-not-ignore-xcompose
#
#   In XCompose, a single keysym hapax is processed for direct output, whereas
#   a keysym followed by another keysym at least once is handled as a dead key
#   throughout, and its singleton output is discarded. Thus, the system “eats”
#   the dead key press if the input sequence is undefined.
#
#   Definition format in XCompose files:
#
#       * Single character output may be defined like in allocation tables,
#         but this format is reportedly not interoperable across XKB.
#       * Strings must be defined as literals delimited by double quotes.
#         This is the interoperable format for single character output, too.
#
#   Both formats may be used concurrently. Therefore, single character output
#   is defined both as a string, which is mandatory, and as a keysym providing
#   a redundant convenience. However, on the result side, the preferred keysyms
#   are Unicode scalars rather than X11 keysyms, that have limited coverage and
#   are not directly interoperable.
#
#   Definition format in allocation tables (Symbols directory):
#   Single character output in any UCS plane may be defined in several formats:
#
#       * Uxxxx[x[x]] hexadecimal
#       * U00xxxxxx hexadecimal
#       * 0x01xxxxxx hexadecimal
#
#   The specified format "\0x123A" does not seem to work.
#   https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.html
#
#   These layouts make extensive use of keysyms added as documented in
#   keysymdef.h:148.
#   /usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h
#   https://fossies.org/linux/tk/xlib/X11/keysymdef.h
#
#   The scheme using Private Use characters instead of missing dead keysyms is
#   found on FDO as well as on GNOME.

#
#
# # Notes about syntax and terms
#
#   Characters and dead keys are referred to by their X11 keysyms as defined in
#   keysymdef.h.
#   https://fossies.org/linux/tk/xlib/X11/keysymdef.h

#   End of line comments
#
#   All lines containing a compose sequence also contain a comment before the
#   end of line, for safety, as it happened that sequences without a trailing
#   numbersign were ignored, and appending a hash fixed the bug. Anyway, EOL
#   comments are specified as optional.

#
#   Headings
#
#   Section headings have three leading hashes for visibility. Then come a set
#   of subsection levels with or without special markup depending on importance
#   and functionality as follows.
#
#   Parsing the multikey section, the generate-multikey-tables.pl script needs
#   a caret between the leading hashes of a subsection heading to start a new
#   subsection partial table file.
#   See # # Notes about documentation
#
#   Parsing the deadkey section, the generate-deadkey-tables.pl script needs
#   an asterisk between the leading hashes of a subsection heading to start a
#   new subsection partial table file.
#   See # # Notes about documentation
#
#   Annotations feature subsection headings marked up by two leading hashes,
#   each one followed by a space. Inside the subsections, low-level subsection
#   headings without extra markup may occur, like here.
#
#
#   Cross-references
#
#   All headings may be used in cross-references starting with "#   See ". Some
#   frequent line starts like "#   Multikey conflicts with" followed by an
#   enumeration, or "#   Multikey is supported as part of math symbols." or 
#   "#   As this dead key exists for" as a typical paragraph start may also be
#   used in this setting.
#
#   As a consequence, edits need to be synced by global search-and-replace.
#
#
#   Multikey sequence notation
#
#   The broken bar "¦" U00A6 is repurposed as multikey symbol.
#   See # # Symbols for multikey
#
#   For readability, inline literal multikey sequences are bracketed with
#   French-style (no-break thin) space padded double angle quotation marks,
#   because quotedbl, grave, period, comma and other ASCII symbols likely to
#   occur next to multikey sequences, may also be part of multikey seqences.
#   The padding space is NBTSP for convenience and consistency. By contrast,
#   the plus sign after modifier key notations is not NBTSP-padded (although
#   it normally should be), for maintainability/searchability, and assuming
#   that NBTSP would be pointless with fixed-width fonts and hard line breaks.
#
#
#   Spelling of "multikey"
#
#   The word "multikey" is not hyphenated. “Multi words are not hyphenated
#   unless such spelling makes for awkward reading.”

# # Breton trigraph
#
#   Breton using "c" only as initial of the two polygraphs "cʼh" and "ch" is
#   prone to being supported by a keyboard layout featuring these as all-in-one
#   strings in lowercase, titlecase (Shift) and uppercase (Caps Lock).
#
#   The Brezhoneg keyboard layout from An drouizig has its key D01 featuring
#   the Breton trigraph.

#
#   The reason why supporting the Breton trigraph as an all-in-one string makes
#   much sense is the required medial letter apostrophe "ʼ" U02BC. Alongside,
#   Breton requires the usual punctuation apostrophe "’" U2019.
#
#   In 2011, James Cloos reported, and Denis Jacquerye confirmed citing CLDR,
#   that the apostrophe in the Breton trigraph is the letter apostrophe U02BC.

#
#   The reason why the Breton trigraph is regularly composed of a "c" and an
#   "h" separated by a letter apostrophe U02BC, not a punctuation apostrophe
#   U2019, is to prevent word boundaries around the apostrophe.
#
#   Consistently, the basic set of exemplar characters for Breton is (at least
#   since CLDR version 21 (2012-02-10)):

#
#   The variants for Breton and French "kbbrFRs" and "kbbrFRsr" have the Breton
#   trigraph at Base level and Shift level of key E01. All variants, including
#   the base variant and the remapped variants, support the Breton trigraph on
#   (Shift +) AltGr + AltFr + A, key D01 as on the CʼHWERTY keyboard layout. On
#   Linux and macOS, this is Caps Lock sensitive, too. Additionally, the letter
#   apostrophe is in group 1 of apostrophe and rightsinglequotemark.

# # Punctuation spacing for French, regular with U202F NBTSP
#
#   French usage of no-break thin space
#
#   This is regular typesetting at Imprimerie nationale except for colon and
#   quotation marks, although the latter are typeset with narrow space in the
#   Imprimerie nationale style guide _Lexique des règles typographiques en
#   usage à l’Imprimerie nationale_, Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 2002; only
#   the rule on page 149 differs.
#
#   Philippe Verdy reported on the Unicode Public mailing list that the most
#   straightforward Unicode character representing this no-break thin space is
#   NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE U+202F.
#   https://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2015-m06/0220.html
#
#   In mainstream high-quality publishing, referred to as new school, no-break
#   thin space is used throughout. This new school is implicitly represented by
#   Éditions Le Robert, recommending thin space to space out the colon, the
#   most outstanding punctuation that old school spaces out using a justifying
#   space. Le Robert states: “Le deux-points est précédé d'une espace fine et
#   suivi d'une espace normale” (the colon is preceded by a thin space and
#   followed by a normal space). And on the MacGeneration forum, claude72 has
#   contributed an explicit documentation of French new school.

#
#   Imprimerie nationale, France does not formally categorize punctuation marks
#   into big punctuation and small punctuation or double punctuation and simple
#   punctuation, nor does it support all punctuation marks: The em dash and the
#   en dash are merged, and the single angle quotation marks U2039 and U203A go
#   unmentioned. Part of the punctuation is spaced out using either of:
#
#       * No-break justifying space, behaving like Unicode’s NBSP U00A0;
#       * No-break thin space, behaving like Unicode’s NBTSP U202F.
#
#   Which one exactly depends on the punctuation mark and on whether we want to
#   know the rules in use at Imprimerie nationale, or if it is about the usage.
#   The semicolon and the question and exclamation marks are typeset exactly as
#   stated in the style guide with a no-break thin space. The colon too, with a
#   no-break justifying space. The double angle quotation marks are ruled like
#   colon but typeset like semicolon.
#
#   The no-break thin space seems to be the “espace fine insécable” mentioned
#   in the Unicode Standard, a no-break clone of Unicode’s thin space TSP U2009
#   designed to be no-break but ultimately released as breaking.
#
#
#   No-break thin space in the Unicode Standard
#
#   Indeed, U202F NNBSP, also known as no-break thin space, is a character that
#   despite being encoded for Mongolian with specific handling intended, was
#   readily adopted for use in French, Philippe Verdy reported, to that
#   extent that it was ultimately a special requirement for Mongolian that
#   brought the long-missing no-break thin space into the UCS, in the block
#   that it actually belongs to, and where it had been available since the
#   beginning if there had been no desire to keep the working-as-intended U2009
#   proprietary.
#   https://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2019-m01/0146.html
#
#   That is the hidden — almost occult — fact where stances like “The NNBSP can
#   be used to represent the narrow space occurring around punctuation
#   characters in French typography, which is called an ‘espace fine
#   insécable.’” (TUS) and “When NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE occurs in French text,
#   it should be interpreted as an ‘espace fine insécable’.” (UAX #14) are
#   stemming from. The underlying meaning is like: “The no-break thin space is
#   usually a vendor-specific layout control in DTP applications; it’s also
#   available via a TeX command. However, if you are interested in an
#   interoperable representation, here’s a Unicode character you can use
#   instead.”
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/core-spec/chapter-6/#G26915
#   https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-51.html#NNBSPdoc
#
#   Unicode was supposed to encode SI/BIPM number typesetting as well as French
#   punctuation typesetting, and for that purpose encoded THIN SPACE along with
#   other typographic space characters in the range U2000..U200A. Accordingly,
#   the line breaking property was set to no-break for all spaces starting with
#   U2002, after the two widest spaces in a breaking variant: U2000, U2001, as
#   opposed to U2002, U2003, consistently with TeX, where \qquad and \quad are
#   breaking, while \emspace, \enspace and \thinspace are no-break. Although
#   this difference does not seem to be documented, it was obviously well known
#   and fostered the original typographical space range design.
#   https://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/knuth/dist/tex/texbook.tex
#   https://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/Archives-Old/UML023/0536.html
#
#   But that design goal was ultimately compromised. To cover up the vandalism,
#   U2007 FIGURE SPACE was left no-break with the allegation that this space is
#   used “in” numbers, and even stating that it is digit-wide, defeating the
#   point in advertising U2007 for use as a group separator. Indeed, U2007 was
#   encoded as the tabular space, to be used before numbers when typesetting
#   tables the old way, alongside indentation by the width of a decimal dot or
#   comma, using U2008 PUNCTUATION SPACE.
#   https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-51.html
#
#       This is the preferred space to use in numbers. It has the same width as
#       a digit and keeps the number together for the purpose of line breaking.
#
#   The corrected Unicode position is found in UAX #14 since 2008, in TUS

#      Narrow No-Break Space. U+202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE (NNBSP) is a narrow
#      version of U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE. The NNBSP can be used to represent the

#
#      The Unicode Standard includes several different space characters.
#      It is acceptable to use THIN SPACE, and then use a higher-level protocol,
#      a word joiner, or tailored line-breaking to prevent line-breaking.
#      Alternatively, NNBSP can be used to force no-break behavior.
#
#   However, higher level protocols and tailoring are inacceptable options when
#   considered for the purpose of digitally representing natural languages, the
#   more as the Unicode Standard specifies that it encodes plain text.

#   In Unicode CLDR, French migrated from NBSP to NNBSP, now NBTSP, wherever
#   applicable, in 2018, when CLDR 34 was released on 2018-10-15.

#   In the release note, section Detailed Data Changes:

#
#      The French locale now uses narrow no-break space U+202F in several
#      places: as the numeric grouping separator, in many short unit patterns,
#      and in the locale display name patterns. It also changed normal space to
#      no-break space U+00A0 in the wide unit patterns.
#
#   In the release note, section Migration:
#   https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-34#h.fm1q7yof3rxz_l
#
#      French grouping separator changed from no-break space U+00A0 to

#   Venetian got its CLDR coverage level raised in 2023, adding the decimal
#   separator and the group separator to the covered data. Since CLDR 44 was
#   released on 2023‑10‑31, the group separator in Venetian is set to U202F,
#   making Venetian the second locale to implement the BIPM recommendation.

#   A triple zero key is useful only on the dedicated numpad. On the level-5
#   numpad, a triple zero is easily input by simultaneously hitting single and
#   double zeros on AltFr + N and AltFr + B. As a consequence, this triple zero

# # Justifying no-break spaces
#
#   NO-BREAK SPACE U00A0 is tailored as fixed-width in word processors other
#   than Microsoft Word 2013, because it is misused for punctuation spacing in
#   lieu of U202F NBTSP, so that it raises issues in Polish, Russian and other
#   locales requiring no-break space as interword space, and thus requiring the
#   no-break space to be justifying as defined. This tailoring without settings
#   for NBSP justification and for the space used in French punctuation spacing
#   and without even locale sensitivity results in an abuse that makes sense as
#   part of the downgrading policy intended to limit word processors’ usability
#   for the interoperable representation of the world’s languages.

#
#   In this file, the reference for XCompose sequences is en_US.UTF-8/Compose,
#   as it is used — and has been designed — in France.
#
#   The maximum number of keysyms is nine. Any longer sequences are going to be
#   ignored by the compiler.
#
#
# # Design of multikey sequences
#
#   Anyway, brevity is key, to that extent that non-critical elements are cut
#   off, resulting in truncated sequences that may be counter-intuitive but are
#   better for a streamlined user experience.

#
#   The generate-multikey-tables.pl script, processing the multikey section,
#   expects a caret between the leading hashes of a subsection heading to start
#   an HTML table partial file, while generate-deadkey-tables.pl, expects an
#   asterisk between the hashes in the same position.
#
#   The dead key tables are numbered, while the multikey tables are not,
#   because their number is not finite, so adding a new file start heading does
#   not alter existing file names. However, as each of these headings is used
#   to make a file name out of it, they are expected to be unique.

#^# Legacy ordinal indicators
#
#   The two Latin-1 ordinal indicators "ª" U00AA FEMININE ORDINAL INDICATOR and
#   "º" U00BA MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR are legacy characters, superseded by
#   the preformatted superscript small letters to be used as ordinal indicators
#   in Italian, Portuguese and Spanish as of "ᵃ" U1D43, "ᵒ" U1D52 and "ˢ" U02E2
#   that allows to support plural forms, as opposed to the legacy characters
#   designed to support singular only, as the most frequent use case, due to
#   scarcity of code points in 8-bit charsets.
#
#   Consistently, preformatted superscripts support French ordinal indicators,
#   too: "ᵈ" U1D48, "ᵉ" U1D49, "ʳ" U02B3, "ˢ" U02E2.
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/23e250bdfdd7b23f5e1fe3c681abf94546aedb1d/common/main/fr.xml#L1602
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/main/fr.xml#L1602
#
#   All preformatted letters benefit from multikey support thanks to multikey
#   equivalents, for instance by <Multi_key><asciicircum><[the letter]>.
#   See #*# SUPERSCRIPT
#   See # # Multikey equivalents
#
#   The two legacy ordinal indicators are supported with alphabetic mnemonics
#   in group 12 of "^" on key "A", and in group 12 of "}" on key "O".
#   See # # D01 asciicircum
#   See # # D09 braceright
#
#   The following intuitive, case insensitive, underscore-terminated multikey
#   sequences add to this support in the symbol groups. Underscore termination
#   is consistent with "№" U2116 NUMERO SIGN in the next section. Many fonts
#   give the legacy ordinal indicators a line below, that is not preferred in
#   French and makes "º" U00BA unfit for use in the abbreviation for "numéro".

#
#^# Abbreviations, Units and Legal Symbols
#
#   A design goal is sideways compatibility with en_US.UTF-8/Compose as used in
#   France. One example is the pilcrow sign "¶" U00B6 by « ¦p! » and « ¦P! ».
#
#   Sequences for "©" U00A9 and "®" U00AE made out of letters only with an "O"
#   or an "o" are based on en_US.UTF-8/Compose, where "℗" U2117 is missing, as
#   ASCII fallback sequences « ¦(C) » and « ¦(R) », probably because the latter
#   would conflict with "Ȓ" U0212. To mitigate these gaps, an alternative with
#   a pair of leading parentheses is proposed consistently: « ¦()C », « ¦()R »,
#   « ¦()P ».
#
#   Order may matter as for "©" U00A9 COPYRIGHT SIGN by « ¦oc » or « ¦Oc », as
#   opposed to "℅" U2105 CARE OF by « ¦co », « ¦Co », « ¦CO » or « ¦cO ».
#
#   Case may matter as for "⅍" U214D AKTIESELSKAB vs "℁" U2101 ADDRESSED TO THE
#   SUBJECT, or for "🄯" U1F12F COPYLEFT SYMBOL vs "℄" U2104 CENTRE LINE SYMBOL.
#
#   Reverse sequences cannot be supported either for "⅍" U214D, because « ¦SA »
#   conflicts with "ر.س" Saudi Riyal by « ¦SAR », and with "♐" U2650 SAGITTARIUS
#   by « ¦SAGI ».
#
#   The fraction-slash-based abbreviations "℀" U2100, "⅍" U214D, "℁" U2101 and
#   "℅" U2105 have alias multikey sequences skipping the slash for brevity, and
#   "℆" U2106 has this alias space terminated to prevent conflicts with a union
#   symbol "∪" U222A multikey sequence based on its nickname.
#
#   « ¦SO » sequences are used fo mathematical symbols, reverse sequences are
#   used for circled letters, other casing pairs are used for German eszett and
#   for the section sign: "§" U00A7 by « ¦sS », as opposed to "ß" U00DF by
#   « ¦ss » or « ¦sz », and "ẞ" U1E9E by « ¦SS » or « ¦Ss ».
#
#   Title case and camel case sequences are also supported; en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#   supports mixed-case sequences as well. E.g. for the Numero sign "№" U2116,
#   it has <Multi_key><N><o> and <Multi_key><N><O>; adding the other two makes
#   for lenient Caps Lock. A trailing underscore however is added consistently
#   with the glyph and with the legacy ordinal indicators "ª" U00AA, "º" U00BA,
#   so as to prevent a conflict with "⊽" U22BD by « ¦NOR ».
#   See #^# Legacy ordinal indicators
#
#   Precomposed ("℃" U2103, "℉" U2109, "Å" U212B) and dedicated ("K" U212A)
#   measurement unit symbols are supported because their use is not discouraged
#   and they are in the Letterlike Symbols block.
#   See #*# RING_ABOVE
#
#   The Letterlike Symbols, however, were not fully supported before v1.6.0.
#   Prior to v1.6.0, important symbols were missing due to not being used in
#   mathematics. This odd time is over since version 1.6.0 added primarily the
#   VERSICLE and RESPONSE symbols "℣" U2123, "℟" U211F, both by multikey and in
#   letter groups 1 and 4.
#   https://forums.steinberg.net/t/versicle-and-response-symbols/729230
#   See # # Letterlike symbols in block U2100 used in mathematics
#
#   Leading or trailing space for distinction is duplicated for nobreakspace
#   support, if synergy with Multi_key or an ASCII symbol matters, consistently
#   with what is done for math symbols.
#   See #   Trailing space
#   See #   Leading space
#
#   Recycling symbols are grouped separately, due to the number of implied
#   sequences.

# # Recycling symbols
#
#   This input method is based on the idea that very widespread and well-known
#   plastic type initialisms should be supported for mnemonics, as well as the
#   initialism "PT" for "plastic type" followed by the conventional number. The
#   remaining numbers are also supported for completeness, and put to good use
#   by supporting the non-numeric symbols "♲" U2672, "♻" U267B, and "♺" U267A
#   associated with digit 8 after 7, rather than 0 that is used for "♲" U2672,
#   consistently with the way the same recycling symbols are supported in the
#   retroflex hook dead key.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2000/00292-n2240.pdf
#   See #*# RETROFLEX_HOOK
#
#   Semi-numeric sequences based on the "plastic type" initialism are
#   also supported.

#^# Circled numbers
#
#   Another multikey implementation of circled digits and circled or squared
#   letters are multikey equivalents of "Greek or circled" dead key dead_greek,
#   because the multikey equivalent of dead_greek is the at sign, due to shape
#   and since its position is D06, both at levels 3 and 4, where AZERTY has the
#   Y key, that French calls "Greek I" ("i grec"). Extending dead_greek to also
#   support circled is convenient, as Greek does not have dedicated digits.
#   See #*# GREEK_OR_CIRCLED
#
#
# # Circled by leading parenthesis
#
#   For numbers by multikey, this intuitive input method is more comprehensive
#   than the Greek or circled dead key, and it is equally efficient, provided
#   that the redundant trailing parenthesis as found in en_US.UTF-8/Compose is
#   dropped, except for the digits 0 to 5 and two circled numbers starting with
#   1: "⑩" U2469, "⑪" U246A, as these conflict with circled numbers or with box
#   drawings with rounded corners "╰" U2570, "╭" U256D, also known as character
#   cell arcs.
#   See #*# GREEK_OR_CIRCLED
#   See #^# CIRCLED
#   See #   Character cell arcs
#
#   This scheme is supported by multikey only, assuming that the use of
#   dead_invertedbreve as a shortcut for the partial <Multi_key><parenleft>
#   would be considered pointless, and for technical consistency as of not
#   mixing up dead keys and multikey.
#   See #^# Box drawings
#
#   However, this only supports basic circled digits and numbers, for sideways
#   compatibility with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, without the font type and color
#   variants, and without circled letters, as these would conflict with
#   dead_invertedbreve.

#^# Roman numerals
#
#   Only Roman numerals not intended for CJK and other vertical text, and not
#   decomposable and thus not discouraged in Latin text are supported, except
#   the Claudian letter "Ↄ" U2183 (and "ↄ" U2184) supported in *dead_reversed.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerals_in_Unicode#Roman_numerals
#   See #*# REVERSED
#
#   To prevent conflicts with some mathematical symbols, the sequences for
#   Roman numerals start consistently with a mnemonic capital R.

#
#   "Æ" U00C6, "æ" U00E6, "Œ" U0152, "œ" U0153 and some other letters are
#   easier input using groups.
#   See #+# GROUP_1
#
#   Titlecase sequences are supported following en_US.UTF-8/Compose, but
#   reverse sequences are not supported since they would not make much sense
#   and are prone to conflicts.
#
#   "Ꝏ" UA74E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER OO is not supported with a titlecase alias,
#   because « ¦Oo » is used for "⊚" U229A CIRCLED RING OPERATOR.
#
#   The letter EZH is represented by digit 3 as a shortcut, in "ɮ" U026E.
#
#   Sequences conflicting with ISO currency codes or others are fixed by space
#   termination along the lines of what is done for math symbols. But this only
#   affects "Æ" U00C6, "æ" U00E6, "Ǳ" U01F1, "ʣ" U02A3, "Ƣ" U01A2, "ƣ" U01A3,
#   "ꝳ" UA773, "Ŋ" U014A, "ŋ" U014B, "Þ" U00DE, "þ" U00FE, most of which are
#   supported in letter group 1.
#   See #   Leading space
#   See #+# GROUP_1

#   Deprecated presentation forms for typographic ligatures are not supported,

#   Glottal stops are supported by multikey for intuitivity thanks to the ASCII
#   representation of unicase glottal stop by digit 7. So these sequences start
#   with "7" and end with a mnemonic character. For convenience, uppercase may
#   add a bar (called a stroke), Modifier letters add the superscript trigger
#   asciicircum.

#
#   Deprecated Latin small letter n preceded by apostrophe requires a curly

# # Spaces
#
#   Since all important space characters are supported on live keys as the only

#   and no-break thin space, dead key based input methods, including multikey,
#   are not required.
#   See # # Punctuation spacing for French, regular with U202F NBTSP
#
#   U00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE is supported in en_US.UTF-8/Compose (by « ¦␣␣ »). But
#   the equally or even more useful U202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE is not. Since
#   both are heavily used in French and consistently supported on live keys,
#   and moreover, the multikey sequence for U00A0 <Multi_key><space><space>
#   conflicts with every single math symbol sequence distinguished by multiple
#   leading spaces, sideways compatible support for U00A0 by multikey needs to
#   be dropped as impossible.
#
#   U2008 PUNCTUATION SPACE is supported in en_US.UTF-8/Compose (by « ¦␣. »),
#   but the matching U2007 FIGURE SPACE, that is used with the same rationale
#   in typesetting old-style tables, is not, although the latter is particular
#   in that it is an outstandig reminder that all spaces U2002..U200A were
#   initially designed to be no-break. As <Multi_key><space><period> conflicts
#   with "∙" U2219, "⋅" U22C5, "⋵" U22F5, "⨰" U2A30, "⩑" U2A51, "⩒" U2A52,
#   "⩪" U2A6A, "⫃" U2AC3, "⫄" U2AC4, and distinguishing these would screw them
#   up (by requiring a double leading space), it is discarded, and support for
#   spaces by dead keys is moved to the space groups altogether.

#
#   Hyphens
#
#   U2010 HYPHEN is not mapped on live key, nor in group 1 of minus, given that
#   its correct representation is the ASCII hyphen U002D. Assigning it an extra
#   scalar has mainly had the adverse effect of fooling a close font designer
#   team into giving U002D a hybrid glyph, fitting neither the expectations for
#   a hyphen, nor those for a minus sign, fully expressing its genericity
#   pointed out in the Code Chart since version 14.0.0 (2021):
#
#       used generically for hyphen, minus sign or en dash, all of which have
#       dedicated alternatives
#
#   https://www.unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_0000.html
#
#   Most confusingly, in the Core Specification, Unicode claims that in what is
#   obviously a matter of font design, the ASCII hyphen U002D is longer than an
#   average HYPHEN U2010, despite virtually all fonts except a single one give
#   both hyphens exactly the same glyph, and the one that does not has been
#   designed under the influence of the new Unicode Standard and its misleading
#   and even downright wrong documentation of the ASCII hyphen and its Unicode
#   counterpart.
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode1.0.0/ch03_1.pdf
#
#   As a consequence, U002D HYPHEN-MINUS stands out among ASCII punctuation in
#   that its usage is sort of deprecated, if not discouraged in current writing
#   in favor of its homoglyph U2010.
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/core-spec/chapter-6/#G6120
#
#   This however is counterbalanced in the section about mathematical symbols,
#   where the ASCII hyphen is categorized as a punctuation and opposed to the
#   minus sign as a math symbol, thus implicitly doing away with the duplicate.
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/core-spec/chapter-22/#G58950
#
#   The Unicode Character Database in XML shows that U2010 is a duplicate of
#   U002D, encoded for an extrinsic undocumented reason discussed below.
#   https://www.unicode.org/Public/16.0.0/ucdxml/ucd.nounihan.flat.zip
#   https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr42/
#   See #   Discussion of the hyphen encoding
#
#       <char cp="002D" age="1.1" na="HYPHEN-MINUS" gc="Pd" ea="Na" lb="HY" SB="SC" blk="ASCII"      />
#       <char cp="2010" age="1.1" na="HYPHEN"       gc="Pd" ea="A"  lb="BA" SB="XX" blk="Punctuation"/>
#
#   Noticeable differences are in East Asian width, in the line break class and
#   in the sentence break property.
#
#   The Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm UAX #14 does not require an extra
#   hyphen for non-numerical contexts, and "HY[phen]" is "B[reak ]A[fter]".
#   https://unicode.org/reports/tr14/#HY
#
#   East Asian width [ea] neither warrants a duplicate hyphen, since Unicode
#   includes UFF0D FULLWIDTH HYPHEN-MINUS, and HYPHEN as "Ambiguous" resolves
#   to "Narrow".
#
#   As of text segmentation, HYPHEN is unspecified, rather than "SC[ontinue]"
#   like HYPHEN-MINUS, and the related specification skips "XX" entirely.
#   https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#SContinue
#
#   Bottom line: U2010 is a useless duplicate of U002D and should be prevented
#   from fully deploying its adverse effects by taking up a live key position,
#   or even only an easy-access dead key input method like in group 1 of U002D.
#   Else, U2010 would screw things up, from undeliverable email to broken links
#   to parse errors.
#
#
#   Discussion of the hyphen encoding
#
#   The reason why Unicode, well aware of the duplicate encoding pitfalls, and
#   carefully avoiding an extra decimal dot, an extra factorial, and an extra
#   punctuation apostrophe, was fooled into double-encoding the hyphen, was the
#   old ISO-8859 misnomer HYPHEN-MINUS, that made its way into ISO/IEC charsets
#   despite ANSI parenthesized "Minus" when designing ASCII, just like "Decimal
#   Point" next.
#   https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub1-2-1977.pdf#page=12
#
#       Parenthesized additions to character names in ASCII
#
#       Space (Normally Nonprinting)
#       Quotation Marks (Diaeresis)
#       Apostrophe (Closing Single Quotation Mark; Acute Accent)
#       Comma (Cedilla)
#       Hyphen (Minus)
#       Period (Decimal Point)
#       Opening Single Quotation Mark (Grave Accent)
#
#   To be consistent, ISO/IEC should have called U002E *PERIOD-DECIMAL-POINT
#   instead of PERIOD, and so on. ISO calling U002D HYPHEN-MINUS instead of
#   *HYPHEN is probably why Unicode encoded U2010, as a matter of getting a
#   character to be named HYPHEN, additionally to encoding U2212 MINUS SIGN.
#
#   If ISO/IEC’s motivation to retain the "-MINUS" appendix was the desire to
#   complete the mathematical base operators beyond U002B PLUS, then why not
#   call U002A *ASTERISK-MULTIPLY, and U002F *SOLIDUS-DIVIDE? Only "MINUS" was
#   appended with a hyphen, prompting people to figure out the (non-existing)
#   reason behind, and to guess that this HYPHEN-MINUS might eventually not be
#   a genuine hyphen. Yet it is, and it is repurposed in programming like so
#   many other symbols. That is most probably how Unicode was fooled into
#   encoding an extra hyphen, not noticing that the hyphen was already there.
#
#   Even the most complete Latin ISO charset ISO/IEC 6937, including PLUS-MINUS
#   and other math operators and even HORIZONTAL BAR, does not feature any of
#   hyphen and minus sign other than the well-established 0x2D, despite several
#   unallocated code points. There was no need for backward compatibility.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.51/ISO/IEC_6937#Codepage_layout
#
#   The real-world fallout of the HYPHEN encoding error is the glyph of U002D
#   in the 1993 typeface Lucida Sans Unicode, whose designers were almost
#   Unicode’s neighbors and decided to break with longstanding practice when
#   noticing in the then-Code Charts that there is an extra hyphen, and misled
#   by the then-Core Specification’s point about “Loose vs. Precise Semantics”
#   stating: “Some ASCII characters have multiple uses, either through
#   ambiguity in the original standards or through accumulated
#   reinterpretations of a limited codeset. For example, 27 hex is defined in
#   ANSI X3.4 as apostrophe (closing single qutation mark; acute accent), and
#   2D hex as hyphen minus. In general, the Unicode standard provides the same
#   interpretation for the equivalent code values, without adding to or
#   subtracting from their semantics. The Unicode standard supplies unambiguous
#   codes elsewhere for the most useful particular interpretations of these
#   ASCII values; the corresponding unambiguous characters are cross-referenced
#   in the character names list for this block. In a few cases, the Unicode
#   standard indicates the generic interpretation of an ASCII code in the name
#   of the corresponding Unicode character, for example U+0027 is
#   APOSTROPHE-QUOTE ’.” In the Code Chart of this block, Unicode points out
#   that the ASCII hyphen is “used for either hyphen or minus sign”
#   consistently with its erroneous ISO name that Unicode was forced to
#   maintain. So, in Lucida Sans Unicode, the ASCII hyphen got that disruptive
#   glyph halving the HYPHEN’s thickness and doubling its length, just a bit
#   less than MINUS SIGN, while nobody noticed that a type foundry is not in a
#   position to force the use of U2010 in current writing in lieu of U002D, and
#   everybody was confident that Unicode’s recommendation would do the trick.

#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode1.0.0/ch03_1.pdf
#
#   The initial draft from Joe Becker read correctly:
#
#       […] and U+002D as "Hyphen (Minus)".
#
#   Indeed ANSI parenthesized the "Minus" part, as it was not an intrinsic part
#   of the character name, only an indication about usage in practice.

#
#   In October 2022, Unicode stopped using Lucida Sans Unicode in the tables of
#   its Standard Annexes and Technical Reports. E.g. in UAX #14:

#   Keyboard support for hyphens
#
#   If the Unicode HYPHEN U2010 is expected to be used routinely as a hyphen,
#   then it must be mapped at the base level just like the ASCII hyphen. That
#   may be feasible on condition that the keyboard layout has a toggle between
#   locale mode and ASCII mode, so as to keep coding out of harm’s way.
#
#   The keyboard layouts configured in these files require such a toggle, but
#   for the purpose of getting digits on unshifted keys in an “ASCII mode” that
#   contrasts with “French mode”. Featuring the Unicode HYPHEN in locale mode
#   would be prone to raising issues and triggering angry feedback about that
#   “fake hyphen” looking like an ASCII hyphen in almost all fonts without
#   working as expected.
#
#   As a consequence, keyboard layout design should not take this extra hyphen
#   U2010 seriously, in order to prevent adverse effects while attempting to
#   support it on live key or by a premium dead key such as group 1 of minus.
#   There, "⁃" U2043 HYPHEN BULLET is supported instead, while HYPHEN is in
#   group 12, like the outdated legacy ordinal indicators "ª" U00AA, "º" U00BA
#   are in group 12 of asciicircum and braceright, respectively.
#   See #^# Legacy ordinal indicators
#   See # # C05 minus
#   See # # D01 asciicircum
#   See # # D09 braceright
#   See # # Fallback input methods for HORIZONTAL BAR
#
#   By contrast, "‑" U2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN is so important that it is on
#   live key E06, level 2.
#   See dispocla.cpp key <AE06>
#
#
#   Input method for hyphens and dashes
#
#   The dashes based on multiples of the em dash encompass 8 characters listed
#   below. Out of these, seven — all but the ASCII hyphen — are supported by a
#   digit-based multikey scheme supporting ten dashes and hyphens, additionally
#   to partial support in groups and diacritical dead keys.
#   See # # Long dashes
#   See #^# DOUBLE_BAR
#   See #^# HIGH_BAR
#   See #*# FLAG
#   See #*# DIAERESIS
#   See # # C05 minus
#
#   The mnemonic of "5" for U2013 EN DASH is the decimal form "0.5" for "½",
#   while U2015 HORIZONTAL BAR is associated with "7" based on "0.75" for "¾".
#
#   The mnemonic of "8" for U2E40 DOUBLE HYPHEN is the shape of the digit.
#
#   The mnemonic of "6" for U2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN is the thumbs-up shape of
#   the digit in appreciation of NON-BREAKING HYPHEN’s extraordinary usefulness
#   in preventing orthographic hyphens from being treated as line break
#   opportunities when they are not.
#
#   By contrast, the "9" mnemonic for U2012 FIGURE DASH is the exact opposite,
#   the thumbs-down shape symbolic when considering that consistently with its
#   white-space counterparts U2007 FIGURE SPACE and U2008 PUNCTUATION SPACE,
#   FIGURE DASH serves literally no purpose unless negative digits are to be
#   indented. The advice to use FIGURE DASH for interval notation disregards
#   the official recommendation to use EN DASH for that purpose since the very
#   first version of the Unicode Core Specification.

#^# Tone bars
#
#   The bar may be a dot, and the stem may be to the right or alternatively to
#   the left. This scheme supports all four sets using digits 1..5 and letters
#   "t" for bar-shaped tone bars, or "i" for dotted tone bars, with leading
#   digits for standard tone bars, or trailing digits for left-stem tone bars.
#
#   Digits are assigned mnemonically from 1 for extra-low, to 5 for extra-high.
#
#   Order matters since the tone bars "꜈" UA708.."꜖" UA716 are supported.
#
#   Since "T" is used for mathematical tack or turnstile symbols, "t" is case
#   sensitive when it occurs in association with leading or trailing "2" or "3"
#   (used for double- and triple-line tacks and turnstiles). Otherwise, both
#   letters are case insensitive so far.
#   See #   Tacks and turnstiles
#
#
# # Standard tone bars
#
#   Shortcuts using visual mnemonic based on capital I are in dead_hook.

#^# Chinantec tone marks
#
#   The dotted Chinantec tone marks "ꜗ" UA717, "ꜘ" UA718 and "ꜙ" UA719 are
#   intuitively supported in dead_abovedot with base characters matching the
#   vertical, diagonal or horizontal dash, but without multikey equivalents,
#   while "ꜚ" UA71A is in dead_horn in lieu of a spacing clone of horn.
#   https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barre_de_ton_chinant%C3%A8que
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2004/04349r-chinantec.pdf
#   See #*# DOT_ABOVE
#   See #*# HORN
#
#   For an unconflicting, partially order insensitive emulation of the
#   deactivated multikey sequences in dead_abovedot, case insensitive "C" is
#   prepended. "ꜚ" UA71A is supported consistently with minus-bar sequences.

#^# Zhuang tone letters
#
#   Zhuang tone letters are casing and thus require sequences with letters,
#   most appropriately with Z avoiding conflicts with tone bars, paired with
#   the digit both ways for ease of input. Zhuang tone one is unwritten.

#^# Bracketing tone marks
#
#   The tone height is denoted by a leading initialism, localized in French and
#   in English and case insensitive except the English sequence for "˼" U02FC,
#   because with a capital L, this would conflict with "⊾" U22BE. The start or
#   end semantics is carried by a trailing parenthesis: « ¦h( », « ¦H( »,
#   « ¦b( », « ¦B( », « ¦l( », « ¦L( », or « ¦h) », « ¦H) », « ¦b) », « ¦B) »,
#   « ¦l) ».
#
#   "꜠" UA720 and "꜡" UA721 are supported alongside, as these are ligatures of
#   begin tone marks and stress, adding a median apostrophe to the sequences,
#   with alias sequences featuring rightsinglequotemark instead.

#   Consistently with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, 2-digit sequences support the vulgar
#   fractions ½, ⅓, ⅔, ¼, ¾, ⅕, ⅖, ⅗, ⅘, ⅙, ⅚, ⅐, ⅛, ⅜, ⅝, ⅞, ⅑ and ⅒ as more

#   See ### Multikey sequences
#
#   Sequences with an interspersed slash are also supported for a predictable,
#   intuitive, consistent, versatile user experience. As a result, fraction
#   numerator 1 "⅟" U215F, in en_US.UTF-8/Compose <Multi_key><1><slash>, has
#   its sequence extended with space accordingly, while it has also a short
#   sequence <Multi_key><1><space>.

# # Degree sign
#
#   On keyboard layouts sideways compatible with French AZERTY having "°" U00B0
#   on live key E11, level 2, and with a level-5 numpad consistent with this
#   feature, the unavailability of en_US.UTF-8/Compose’s support of the degree
#   sign by <Multi_key><o><o> conflicting with "ꝏ" UA74F LATIN SMALL LETTER OO
#   does not negatively affect the user experience.
#   See dispocla.cpp ## Level-5 numpad
#
#   However, the degree sign is supported by dead key, too, if only to improve
#   the usability of multikey. The most straightforward candidates are "0" and
#   "8" as base characters of dead_abovering, given that "o" is required for
#   "ⱺ" U2C7A. For multikey, the outcome is <Multi_key><asterisk><0> or -<8>,
#   and the dead key working as a de facto shortcut goes <dead_abovering><0> or
#   <dead_abovering><8>.

#   In keysymdef.h, 15 bullets are supported, but some comments may not match
#   the output in some environments.
#   https://fossies.org/linux/tk/xlib/X11/keysymdef.h
#
#   Initially, for these bullets, the results were defined as X11 keysyms, but
#   the scheme was mainly designed for test purposes. This new facility may be
#   uncommented as needed. Both lists are ordered by Unicode scalars.

#   "☚" U261A and "☛" U261B are no emoji, yet these are rendered as emoji on
#   Microsoft PCs, with the upside that finger-pointing emoji are less screwed
#   up, as opposed to the backhand index pointing left or right U1F448, U1F449,
#   in the SMP and thus harder to input by dead keys on Windows. However all of
#   these are questionable since finger-pointing is bad practice, as opposed to
#   hand-pointing: "🫱" U1FAF1 RIGHTWARDS HAND,"🫲" U1FAF2 LEFTWARDS HAND.

#^# Currency symbols
#
#   Symbol-letter sequences are used as multikey equivalents of dead keys, and
#   equal in particular is used for regional indicator letters, so only letter-
#   symbol sequences are available for currency symbols by multikey.
#   See #*# CURRENCY
#
#   These are symbols supported in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, including commented-out
#   ones completed on a best-guess basis.
#   But unlike set up in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, <Multi_key><C><bar> is "₵" U20B5.
#   And "¢" U00A2 is <Multi_key><bar><c> only, due to conflicts with "ȼ" U023C,
#   "⊄" U2284 and "⊈" U2288.
#   See #*# CURRENCY
#   See #*# MACRON
#   See #*# STROKE
#
#   The generic currency symbol "¤" U00A4 is supported by case insensitive X O
#   sequences. Reverse sequences conflict with mathematical symbols.

# # Currency symbols by ISO codes
#
#   This only supports non-trivial symbols. Dollar sign and results made of
#   sequences including Latin base letters and punctuation are commented out,
#   as several of these conflict with legal symbols "™" by « ¦tm », "℅" by
#   « ¦co », or with letters.
#
#   Pound sign is commented out too as conflicting and easy to input on live
#   keys.

#
#   Trailing redundant letters are maintained with respect to ISO codes and for
#   a predictable behavior, unlike what is done for ad-hoc sequences as used in
#   the Zodiacal signs and Math symbol sections.

#   The traditional signs are also included in group 9.
#
#   Input sequences are based on Latin names and on French names and mostly are
#   four characters long, for conflictless consistency. Ultimately however, any
#   redundant characters are cropped for a streamlined user experience and also
#   to avoid superfluous dead keys on Windows.
#   See #   Streamlining
#   See #   Conflictlessness check
#
#   Base 16 numeric sequences are also supported, not conflicting with vulgar
#   fractions where for efficiency, the slash is not mandatory, only supported
#   for intuitivity. These are terminated by asterisk, not started, avoiding
#   conflicts with dead_abovering.

#
#   Be it the one or the other, due to the shape of digit 3, hearts are parsed
#   from the bottom to the top, unlike faces of smilies parsed from the top to
#   the bottom: ":)" or ":-)". This is obvious when looking at the opposite, as
#   "(-:" is in use with the semantic of an actual upside-down face. The fix is
#   to use digit 8 instead, since digit 8 is usable both ways. Hence the
#   sequence used for "♡" U2661 as a math symbol.
#   See "♡" U2661
#   See # # Miscellaneous Symbols in block U2600 used in mathematics
#
#   For completeness, the remaining digits are supported, too, since all these
#   sequences are deactivated consistently as multikey equivalents.
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#   See #^# Bullets
#
#   Previously, the heart emoji logic was followed through, supporting the full
#   set of filled suits (emoji "♥" U2665, "♣" U2663, "♦" U2666, "♠" U2660) and
#   outlined suits (non-emoji "♡" U2661, "♧" U2667, "♢" U2662, "♤" U2664).

# # Symbols for multikey
#
#   Input composition, also known as multikey, may be represented by a low-end
#   alternative "¦" U00A6 additionally to the high-end "⎄" U2384 ISO symbol.
#   The rationale is better font support and a slimmer, less bulky, visually
#   less impacting, less outstanding glyph design in documentation, since the
#   ISO symbol did not make it onto many keyboards, partly because dedicating
#   an entire key to input composition rather than a mere (possibly level-3)
#   key position is not recommended in the presence of a group dead key (UEFD0)
#   providing a more powerful input method for common digraphs. Downgrading the
#   multikey symbol from "⎄" U2384 to "¦" U00A6 consistently stands for a more
#   streamlined, less screwed-up user experience.
#
#   The ISO/IEC 9995-7 symbol "⎄" U2384 is supported by case insensitive
#   « ¦cmp ». Not « ¦com », to prevent conflicts with "℅" U2105.

#
#   The broken bar "¦" U00A6 is repurposed as multikey symbol, and consistently
#   it is the dead character of Multi_key. Given that Multi_key double press is
#   not used, this is supported as a means to input "¦" U00A6.

#
#   The sideways compatible sequence « ¦!^ » as in en_US.UTF-8/Compose could be
#   supported in dead_belowdot, but since the relationship to the dead key is
#   merely fortuitous, it is here without the dead key alternative, and without
#   the reverse sequence, that is used in en_US.UTF-8/Compose for letters with

#^# Box drawings
#
#   Being widely used in documentation of keyboard layouts in source code and
#   in plain text email footers, among other usages, box drawings in the Basic
#   Multilingual Plane are supported extensively, for usability, so as to meet
#   expected user expectations.
#   https://www.unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_2500.html
#   https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/025.html
#
#   Box drawings are supported by multikey only, assuming that dead_breve as a
#   shortcut for <Multi_key><parenright> would be considered pointless, and for
#   technical consistency as of not mixing up dead keys and multikey.
#   See # # Circled by leading parenthesis
#
#   The mnemonic uses the leading parenright, as parenright is on C04 "F",
#   consistently with the box drawings’ French name "filets".
#
#   As an exception to the rule, sequences for character cell arcs start with
#   parenleft for graphic mnemonic based on the shape of uppercase letter D on
#   C03, that parenleft is on, and with proximity mnemonic, as the bulk of box
#   drawings starts with parenright on key "F", C04.
#   See #   Character cell arcs
#
#
# # Classic box drawings
#
#   The digit position sets the direction clockwise:
#
#       First digit:  right;
#       Second digit: down;
#       Third digit:  left;
#       Fourth digit: up.
#
#   The digit sets the stroke type:
#
#       0 for none;
#       1 for light;
#       2 for double;
#       3 for heavy.
#
#   Example: <1><0><1><0> : "─" U2500 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT HORIZONTAL.
#
#   Multiple dashes are input by the number of dashes, typed once for light,
#   twice for heavy, terminated by "h" for horizontal, or "v" for vertical,
#   as in <3><h> : "┄" U2504 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT TRIPLE DASH HORIZONTAL, and in
#   <3><3><h> : "┅" U2505 BOX DRAWINGS HEAVY TRIPLE DASH HORIZONTAL.
#
#   Diagonals are input by 1 for the slash slant, 2 for the backslash slant,
#   both 1 and 2 for a cross, and terminated by "d" for diagonal, as in
#   <1><d> : "╱" U2571 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT DIAGONAL UPPER RIGHT TO LOWER LEFT,
#   <1><2><d> : "╳" U2573 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT DIAGONAL CROSS.

#   The General Category "Symbol, other" (So) does not preclude a symbol from
#   being a math symbol, despite there is the dedicated "Symbol, math" (Sm).

#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/UnicodeStandard-15.0.pdf#page=199
#
#   Indeed both Sm and So are only informative, not normative. The reason why
#   is that labeling all math symbols as Sm is not feasible, and it is not
#   advisable either, since mathematics repurposed many symbols intrinsically
#   extraneous to mathematics, such as the male and female signs, already
#   supercharged as planet symbols ("♀" U2640, "♂" U2642), three music symbols,
#   one of which is Sm ("♯" U266F) and two, So ("♭" U266D, "♮" U266E), and the
#   first four suits, regardless whether filled or empty ("♠" U2660, "♡" U2661,
#   "♢" U2662, "♣" U2663), but not the last four.
#
#   The derived Unicode property "Math" in turn still only defines a subset of

#
# # Design of math sequences
#
#   Mnemonicity
#
#   Supporting all math symbols by multikey would be pointless if this was only
#   to introduce another steep learning curve. Therefore, any multikey sequence
#   must be deducible from the symbol’s shape. To achieve this, every symbol is
#   parsed according to simple rules, applied consistently. Resulting conflicts
#   are uniformly resolved by prepending spaces rather than by arbitrary means,
#   such as randomly duplicating or inverting multikey sequence constituents. A
#   well-designed sequence is mnemonic thanks to its intuitivity.
#
#
#   Streamlining
#
#   Intuitivity and efficiency are key, with the stress on efficiency, so that
#   a sequence may appear truncated because the output is already clear before
#   a pattern is finished, as for "⦭" U29AD, "⦫" U29AB, "⦮" U29AE, "⦯" U29AF.
#   Redundant characters are cropped, even as many as for "⤐" U2910, both for
#   a streamlined user experience and to avoid superfluous dead keys on Windows
#   where composition is implemented using chained dead keys. In XCompose, by
#   contrast, useless trailing multikey sequence constituents are only revealed
#   while checking conflictlessness, and need then to be removed carefully for
#   the purpose of not imposing any useless workload on end users.
#   See #   Conflictlessness check
#
#   When streamlining defeats intuitivity and consistency, more consistent and
#   intuitive sequences are supported alongside, as for "⇺" U21FA, "⇻" U21FB,
#   where the minus standing for the stem next to the arrowhead is optionally
#   supported, because skipping this constituent is unfeasible for "⇷" U21F7,
#   "⇸" U21F8 due to conflicts with horizontal-only special arrows featuring
#   outline heads while the stem is plain: "⇽" U21FD, "⇾" U21FE. (The third one
#   is "⇿" U21FF.) As a result, the vertical counterparts "⤈" U2908, "⤉" U2909
#   have both the streamlined sequences for convenience, and the long sequences
#   for intuitivity.
#
#   Sequences streamlined by cropping non-critical input besides trailing space
#   are duplicated full-length and commented out for the record, right above
#   the streamlined sequences, in case some of them need to be restored later
#   to prevent conflicts with new sequences (as it happened for "⊟" U229F,
#   "⋕" U22D5, "⏢" U23E2, "⧈" U29C8), assuming that this is a good place to
#   store this information.
#   See #Multi_key><
#
#
#   Design schemes
#
#   Math sequences are set up using one of two design schemes, or both:
#
#     * Description: ASCII symbols are used as basic shapes and concatenated to
#       mimick the symbol’s shape, as for "⋈" U22C8 BOWTIE and "⨝" U2A1D JOIN;
#
#     * Modification: An ASCII symbol is used as an attribute and appended to a
#       preceding symbol, that may be a single character as for "⁺" U207A, or a
#       description as for "⇖" U21D6.
#
#
#   Parsing order
#
#   Symbols supported by descriptive sequences are parsed consistently with the
#   Latin script, from left to right and from top to bottom. As a result, for
#   many patterns like "⤧" U2927, parsing starts in the upper left corner.
#   Consistently, it also goes down the z axis first, if there is any, as in
#   "⤫" U292B, "⤬" U292C.
#
#   Symbols for angles, however, are parsed counter-clockwise, for consistency
#   and to keep things simple and straightforward.
#   See #   Angle symbols
#
#
#   Order sensitivity
#
#   As far as possible, descriptive sequences for symmetric symbols such as
#   "⋈" U22C8 BOWTIE and "⨝" U2A1D JOIN are fully or partly symmetric for the
#   purpose of enhancing UX. The same holds true for sequences with attributes,
#   with this section supporting trailing attributes, while related dead keys
#   have multikey equivalents with the attribute in leading position.
#   See "⨢" U2A22
#   See "⨣" U2A23
#   See # # Superscript or subscript signs, symbol, punctuation
#   See "⁺" U207A
#
#   By contrast, many sequences are required to be order sensitive, as for
#   "±" U00B1 and "∓" U2213, "⨤" U2A24 and "⨦" U2A26.
#   See # # Plus minus
#
#
#   Trailing space
#
#   For a conflictless support of variable length sequences, space termination
#   is required for many math symbols, unless trailing space is non-critical.
#   Both ASCII space and Latin-1 no-break space are supported as terminating
#   space, the no-break space because in French mode, it is mapped at level 3,
#   in synergy with the ASCII symbols, that are likely to occur at the end of
#   math symbol multikey sequences; if not, U+00A0 is supported regardless, for
#   consistency and maintainability and with respect to a following number that
#   may need to be connected to the symbol by a no-break space.
#
#
#   Leading space
#
#   When things do not work as expected, the likely culprit is a conflict with
#   a dead key equivalent as for "≪" U226A, "≫" U226B, "⋘" U22D8, "⋙" U22D9.
#   To fix these issues, sequences start with a space, or interchangeably with
#   a no-break space, supported for the sake of synergy with the Multi_key dead
#   key, mapped invariably at level 3, both in French mode, where it is on key
#   E12, and in ASCII mode where it is also on key D12; yet the space character
#   at level 3 is no-break space in French mode, ASCII space in ASCII mode.
#
#   Distinguishing math sequences from each other is another usage for leading
#   space. This occurs when intuitivity requires similar sequences for various
#   symbols, like for "⋈" U22C8 BOWTIE and "⨝" U2A1D JOIN.
#
#   This scheme may require prepending multiple spaces. Then the level-3/AltGr
#   modifier key may be released before any of them, in particular in French
#   mode where level 3 of the space bar is no-break space.
#
#   Examples involving single or multiple leading [nobreak]space:
#   Single:    "∕" U2215, "∖" U2216, "∣" U2223, "∼" U223C;
#   Double:    "⧸" U29F8, "⧂" U29C2, "⧜" U29DC, "◽" U25FD, "⤶" U2936;
#   Triple:    "⟋" U27CB and "⟍" U27CD;
#   Quadruple:  "⁄" U2044 and "⧵" U29F5.
#
#
#   Negation
#
#   Negated sequences work the other way around: letters first, slash last,
#   to further prevent conflicts with dead key equivalents, as in "∄" U2204,
#   "∅" U2205, "∉" U2209.
#
#   However, to distinguish partial negations from full negations, the slash
#   may not be the last character, as for "≇" U2247 versus "≆" U2246. Other
#   examples include "⊈" U2288 versus "⊊" U228A, "⋢" U22E2 versus "⋤" U22E4,
#   "≴" U2274 and "≵" U2275 versus "⋦" U22E6 and "⋧" U22E7.
#
#   Another option is slash always last, and leading space for partial, but
#   this would be less efficient and even less intuitive.
#
#   Yet another option is to have a slash after each negated element, but this
#   would be tedious and streamlined to the first option, as the negated part
#   is always at the bottom.
#
#
#   Reverse or turned symbols
#
#   For opposite or reverse relationships, when the symbol is turned, flipped
#   horizontally or vertically, a matching alternate slug is used, as well as
#   duplication or a trailing transform.
#
#   The preferred or primary slug for simple symbols is a simple letter. So,
#   while for superset "⊂" U2282, the matching "c" is used, and "ɔ" for subset
#   "⊃" U2283 is not in the base alphabet, "b" is used instead.
#
#   But for intuitivity, "cc" is supported as well. So is "c\", where backslash
#   is the transform for reversed, due to multikey equivalence.
#   See #*# REVERSED
#
#   The goal is to provide both streamlined and intuitive input methods.
#
#   Most slugs use graphic mnemonics, while H and CP use alphabetic mnemonics
#   based on HARP for "∇" U2207 or on COPRODUCT for "∐" U2210.
#
#   When graphic mnemonic competes with alphabetic mnemonic, the former has
#   precedence, so that "m" is used for "⧢" U29E2, not "∋" U220B.
#
#   Examples:
#
#   Symbol A   Slug |  Symbol B   Primary  Duplication  Trailing transform
#   "∈" U2208  e    |  "∋" U220B  p        ee           e\
#   "⊂" U2282  c    |  "⊃" U2283  b        cc           c\
#   "∆" U2206  D    |  "∇" U2207  H                     D%
#   "∨" U2228  v    |  "∧" U2227  a        vv           v%
#   "⩖" U2A56  w    |  "⩕" U2A55  aa                    w%
#   "⨈" U2A08  W    |  "⨇" U2A07  AA                    W%
#   "∏" U220F  P    |  "∐" U2210  CP                    P%
#
#
#   Brackets and lozenges
#
#   The rule about trailing transforms also holds true when the transform is a
#   bracket, as for "⟨" U27E8, "⟩" U27E9 and other angle brackets and flattened
#   parentheses, as well as for the angle-bracket composition of lozenges for
#   "◊" U25CA, "⟠" U27E0, "⧫" U29EB, additionally to the and-or composition.
#
#   The transform bracket is not left-right sensitive, as both the opening and
#   the closing bracket are supported in this position, given that insisting on
#   the correct bracket being entered would be pointless and induce a useless
#   complication contrary to the streamlined user experience design principle.
#
#   This scheme is also the most efficient, since the bracket has a terminator
#   status after the appropriate number of less or greater as for "⟨" U27E8,
#   "⟩" U27E9 and "⟪" U27EA, "⟫" U27EB.
#
#   However, in the case of "⦗" U2997, "⦘" U2998, it is not sure what should be
#   the the trailing transform. So, both ways are supported.
#
#
#   Slanted symbols
#
#   Some slanted math symbols are glyph variants selected by VS1 UFE00.
#   https://www.unicode.org/Public/16.0.0/ucd/StandardizedVariants.txt
#   https://unicode.org/Public//6.2.0/ucd/StandardizedVariants.html
#
#   But many math symbols with slanted equal sign are hard-coded characters:
#   "⩽" U2A7D, "⩾" U2A7E, "⩿" U2A7F, "⪀" U2A80, "⪁" U2A81, "⪂" U2A82,
#   "⪃" U2A83, "⪄" U2A84, "⪓" U2A93, "⪔" U2A94, "⪕" U2A95, "⪖" U2A96,
#   "⪗" U2A97, "⪘" U2A98, "⪛" U2A9B, "⪜" U2A9C, "⪨" U2AA8, "⪩" U2AA9,
#   "⫹" U2AF9, "⫺" U2AFA. Some of these do not have straight equivalents.
#   https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/1521
#
#   If the slanted form is not canonical, and there is a competing straight and
#   horizontal (single-line or double-line) equal, as for "⪙" U2A99, "⪚" U2A9A
#   versus "⪛" U2A9B, "⪜" U2A9C, the slanted one is distinguished by trailing
#   grave, with mnemonics based on the backtick’s slant.
#
#   This scheme seems better than repurposing the underscore for slanted, and
#   introducing minus for not slanted, screwing up some arrows in the process.
#
#
#   Underscore and overscore
#
#   While sequences for double-line-equal symbols are made with the equal sign,
#   single-line equal translates to underscore throughout, at any position in
#   the symbol: bottom, center, and top, This scheme also enhances sideways
#   compatibility with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, that does not support any slanted
#   form, and uses underscore for single-line equal in "≤" U2264, "≥" U2265.
#
#   This also holds true for centered bars without "equal" semantics, as in
#   "⩈" U2A48, "⩉" U2A49.
#
#   Consistently, an overscore as in "⩂" U2A42, "⩃" U2A43, "⊼" U22BC, "⊽" U22BD
#   translates to a leading underscore in the sequence, while for "⊻" U22BB,
#   the underscore is in trailing position, as vertically stacked symbols are
#   parsed from top to bottom.
#
#   However, leading underscore is prone to conflicts with the subscript dead
#   key. Therefore, leading minus may be supported alongside as an alternative
#   for brevity, making up streamlined shortcuts, as for "⩞" U2A5E.
#
#
#   Underscore in arrows and harpoons
#
#   However, for intuitivity, underscore is used in alternative sequences for
#   combining arrows and harpoons below "⃬" U20EC.."⃯" U20EF, as opposed to the
#   same above where only minus is used for the stem.
#
#   The long dash in "⥪" U296A, "⥫" U296B, "⥬" U296C, "⥭" U296D is considered
#   as an under- or overscore rather than a barbless harpoon, due to the effect
#   of underscore causing less conflicts than minus (only a single one:
#   "⥭" U296D with "₋" U208B), and as a result, requiring less leading spaces,
#   for a more streamlined user experience.
#
#
#   Arrows and harpoons
#
#   Arrows are better supported thanks to this scheme, with the minus dedicated
#   to horizontal stems, the exclamation mark to vertical stems, the slash and
#   backslash to diagonal stems, while the pipe is required for an actual bar,
#   as in "⤆" U2906, "⤇" U2907, "↥" U21A5, "↧" U21A7.
#
#   Since double arrows also occur in all eight directions, non-horizontal ones
#   use appended equal in conjunction with \, !, / for the few existing, namely
#   the basic "⇑" U21D1, "⇓" U21D3, "⇕" U21D5, "⇖" U21D6, "⇗" U21D7, "⇘" U21D8
#   and "⇙" U21D9. As a result, "⇕" U21D5 is input like "↕" U2195 with appended
#   equal. For consistency with triple and quadruple arrows, appended digit 2
#   is also supported.
#
#   Triple and quadruple arrows use appended digit 3 or 4, as for "⇛" U21DB,
#   "⤊" U290A, "⤋" U290B, "⟰" U27F0, "⟱" U27F1. In this role, digits are
#   appended like those denoting size as for "◻" U25FB, while multiplying
#   digits are prepended as for "⇇" U21C7, "⇶" U21F6, "∬" U222C, "⋐" U22D0.
#
#   Squiggle arrows "⇜" U21DC, "⇝" U21DD, "⟿" U27FF, "⬳" U2B33 use asciitilde
#   at least twice, for intuitivity. As a result, the triple asciitilde of the
#   long variants is consistent only with triple minus/equal variant sequences
#   of the other long arrows, due to single asciitilde being required for wave
#   arrows "↜" U219C, "↝" U219D (the directly pointing variants "⤳" U2933 and
#   "⬿" U2B3F have a minus stem segment before their arrowhead), while normal
#   length squiggle arrows "⇜" U21DC, "⇝" U21DD are intuitively input by the
#   means of double asciitilde sequences.
#
#   Vertical arrow heads are composed as if they were turned 90° to the left,
#   because stacked symbols are parsed from top to bottom; heads of up arrows
#   translate to less, as for "↑" U2191, "⇑" U21D1, "⦽" U29BD; heads of down
#   arrows become greater, as for "↓" U2193, "⇓" U21D3.
#
#   Harpoon barbs, by contrast, become grave or apostrophe/rightsinglequotemark
#   depending on their slant, regardless of stem direction.
#
#
#   Angle symbols
#
#   Angles are parsed counter-clockwise in the geometrically positive direction
#   while translating a horizontal angle leg to minus, like a horizontal arrow
#   stem, not underscore, because we have "⦤" U29A4 and "⦥" U29A5 including an
#   actual underscore, and also to prevent too many conflicts with subscript
#   parentheses "₍" U208D, "₎" U208E in the sequences for "⦨" U29A8.."⦯" U29AF.
#
#   By contrast, vertical angle legs are bar, as in "⟀" U27C0, not exclam like
#   vertical arrow stems.
#
#   For simplicity, right angle is "L", as in "∟" U221F, "⊾" U22BE, "⦜" U299C.
#
#   All angle symbols are parsed as interior angles, not reflex angles. Some
#   symbols are explicit about this, like "∡" U2221; others like "∠" U2220 are
#   assumed to refer to the same angle.
#
#
#   Tacks and turnstiles
#
#   The most straightforward multikey sequences for tacks are based on capital
#   letter "T", with both graphic and alphabetic mnemonics. Non-down tacks have
#   a trailing transform in their sequence: "%" for down tacks, with a multikey
#   equivalent based mnemonic, and "<" for left tacks, ">" for right tacks.
#
#   Tacks pointing both ways have order insensitive less and greater, or double
#   percent, or double "T" and single percent for intuitivity.
#
#   Various lengths (short, long) are supported by leading space or by trailing
#   additional transforms: "'" for short tacks, "|" for long tacks, at the very
#   end of the sequence (unless space termination is required, but mostly it is
#   not, then).
#
#   Tacks with a multiple-line head have a leading digit (typically 2 or 3) in
#   their sequence, and those with multiple stems (again 2 or 3) have a digit
#   after the "T". Part of these are referred to as turnstiles instead.
#
#   Supporting T-based sequences throughout is part of a last move, requiring
#   some adaptation in tone bar sequences for the purpose, while descriptive
#   sequences are kept for variety, assuming that removing any is not desirable
#   at this point.
#   See #^# Tone bars
#
#
#   Small symbols
#
#   Small alternative symbols ("∊" U220A, "∍" U220D, "⋷" U22F7, "⋾" U22FE,
#   "⋼" U22FC, "⋴" U22F4, "⩡" U2A61) are distinguished from normal-size
#   symbols by a trailing comma, rather than grave or period, with size-based
#   mnemonic and to prevent overuse of grave and period.
#
#
#   Outsourcing to dead keys
#
#   Slash, pipe, and backslash in leading position followed by a trailing digit
#   are in the related dead keys for consistency, where the multikey sequences
#   are not space terminated, matching common dead key bebavior.
#
#   Slash: "∕" U2215, "⧸" U29F8, "⟋" U27CB, "⁄" U2044.

#
#   Vertical bar: "⫾" U2AFE, "∣" U2223, "‖" U2016, "⦀" U2980, "∥" U2225,

#   See #*# MACRON
#
#   Backslash: "∖" U2216, "⧹" U29F9, "⟍" U27CD, "⧵" U29F5.

#
#   Alternative keysyms
#
#   Sequences including quotedbl need to be duplicated using EuroSign instead,
#   since EuroSign replaces quotedbl on AltGr/Option + E.
#
#   Sequences including semicolon need to be duplicated using section instead,
#   since on key B10, the section sign replaces the semicolon in French mode.
#
#   As rightsinglequotemark is on the apostrophe key in French mode, sequences
#   with apostrophe should also work with rightsinglequotemark. Yet apostrophe
#   is on key E12, at the same (base) level as rightsinglequotemark on E04.
#
#
# # Not sign
#
#   The not sign is also in group 4 of grave on the N key.
#
#   These sequences need to be consistent with those of "⫬" U2AEC and "⫭" U2AED
#   below. There is also a non-math TURNED NOT SIGN "⌙" U2319.

# # Invisible operators
#
#   For intuitivity, these sequences use a leading ampersand, like those of the
#   combining diacritics used in mathematics, that invisible operators have the
#   lack of advance width in common with.
#   See # # Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols used in mathematics
#
#   This scheme prevents "⨯" U2A2F from needing two leading spaces rather than
#   a single one, to distinguish it from "×" U00D7.
#
#   Thanks to conflictlessness, space termination is skipped throughout. The
#   resulting uncertainty due to the lack of visual feedback is mitigated by
#   the cursor advance when a space is typed hereafter.
#
#   Two of these are supported on live keys: "⁣" U2063 INVISIBLE SEPARATOR on
#   B07, "⁤" U2064 INVISIBLE PLUS on C06.

#   support.
#
#   Unlike half of the below, the multikey equivalents in super/subscript are

# # Letterlike symbols in block U2100 used in mathematics

#   Many of these are included in groups 6 to 10, where the complete sets of
#   alphanumeric mathematical symbols are supported. Not so the liter symbol
#   "ℓ" U2113, as "𝓁" U1D4C1 is encoded separately.
#   See # # Mathematical Latin alphabets and digits
#   See # # Mathematical Greek alphabets and symbols
#
#   Sequences for double-struck or outlined symbols use duplication, script is
#   a trailing asciitilde, blackletter is numbersign, Hebrew gets a trailing
#   backslash based on the shape of aleph (for instance the symbol "ℵ" U2135)
#   although backslash is also the ASCII equivalent of reversed, Greek gets a
#   trailing at sign, and italic translates to a trailing slash, although in
#   other instances, this is used to denote negation: "∄" U2204, "∅" U2205.

#   The duplicate minus in the descriptive sequences for "⊢" U22A2, "⊣" U22A3
#   is required because single minus is used for "⊦" U22A6 ASSERTION and
#   "⫞" U2ADE SHORT LEFT TACK. The "T"-based sequences are more powerful and
#   straightforward as soon as the scheme is known.

#   reserving backslash-slash for BOWTIE, under the rule that parsing starts in

#   The following alternative sequences for "⤐" U2910 account for the tail that
#   is displayed by some fonts (DejaVu Serif). The full sequences including a
#   leading space required because of "₀" U2080 skip the first minus for the
#   stem end next to the tail under the maximum 9 keysyms constraint:
#
#       <Multi_key><space><greater><0><minus><0><minus><greater><greater>
#
#   But most of this is non-critical and is therefore cropped, so that the stem
#   next to the tail is readded. Yet the streamlined sequence still stops after
#   the first gap.

#   The sequences for "⦨" U29A8.."⦯" U29AF are composed parsing the symbols in
#   the positive direction, counter-clockwise, and the arrowed angle leg like
#   an arrow stem and head. With respect to "⦤" U29A4, "⦥" U29A5 and to prevent
#   conflicts with "₍" U208D and "₎" U208E, a horizontal leg is minus, like a
#   horizontal arrow stem, not underscore. For efficiency, the trailing slash
#   of "⦫" U29AB is cropped, and so are the trailing less and backslash of
#   "⦭" U29AD, the trailing greater of "⦮" U29AE, and the bar of "⦯" U29AF.

#   Consistently, "⦽" U29BD is parsed as « ¦O<! » rather than « ¦O^| » that was
#   an intuitive option by lack of the rules making « ¦O<! » more predictable.
#   The other way around for intuitivity is prevented from screwing up the
#   simple up arrow "↑" U2191 and can therefore be streamlined by cropping it
#   to the same length.

#   "⧵" U29F5 REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR and "∖" U2216 SET MINUS are at least
#   nearly homoglyphs, may be confused and have the potential to cause issues.
#   “\setminus translated as U29F5 ⧵ REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR causes problems”
#   https://github.com/tudace/tuda_latex_templates/issues/409
#
#   By contrast, disunifying "⧵" U29F5 from the semantically overloaded
#   backslash "\" U005C is so straightforward it goes unmentioned in TUS,
#   Table 22-5. Mathematical Operators Disunified from Punctuation.

#   Fonts may give the duplicate a slight difference in slant. One example is
#   DejaVu Sans Mono Book.
#
#   "∕" U2215 DIVISION SLASH, however, does not have any *SOLIDUS OPERATOR
#   equivalent. Therefore, U29F5 is distinguished by a quadruple leading space.
#   For convenience, these [back]slash symbols are alternatively distinguished
#   by a trailing digit, also those with a single leading space for consistency
#   in the related dead key (without space termination).
#   See #*# REVERSED
#
#   Anyway, "⧵" U29F5 is in the benefit of a short sequence where the small "o"
#   is exceptionally not used for its graphic, but as the initial of "operator"
#   with cross-language mnemonics.

#   While the symbol of the dot product is the dot operator "⋅" U22C5, the
#   symbol of the cross product "⨯" U2A2F is confusable with the Latin-1
#   multiplication symbol "×" U00D7, that it seems to have been disunified
#   from. Yet mathematical operators disunified from Latin-1 operators are
#   not documented like in Table 22-5. Mathematical Operators Disunified
#   from Punctuation.

# # LaTeX codes
#
#   Since the maximum number of keysyms is 9, including the initial Multi_key
#   press, many LaTeX commands need to be truncated to make working multikey
#   sequences out of them, limiting this input method’s usability.
#
#   Most short sequences require space termination to prevent conflicts with
#   longer sequences starting the same way. This is consistent with the way
#   TeX control words are terminated.

### Greek with diacritics
#
#   Polytonic Greek is supported alongside to meet eventual user expectations,
#   despite its exclusion from the French NF Z71-300:2019 standard. To achieve
#   this, precomposed polytonic Greek letters are supported, although Unicode
#   advises to use Greek base letters with combining diacritics instead, since
#   not providing the ability to input diacriticized Greek letters by dead key
#   may be considered counter-intuitive. The only cross-platform compatible
#   way to achieve this requires precomposed letters, so as to avoid composed
#   dead key output.
#   https://www.unicode.org/faq/greek.html
#
#   As a consequence, dead keys for Latin diacritics are extended consistently,
#   except that for mnemonics, dead_invertedbreve and dead_breve stand for the
#   dasia and psili aspiration marks, instead of the latter for breve length.
#   The few occurrences of precomposed vrachy are in dead_caron, with the
#   mnemonic upside that the mapping of dead_caron on the "V" key also matches
#   the initial of vrachy.
#   See #   Dead key layout overview
#   See # # Order of dead key lists
#
#       dead_acute              oxia
#       dead_grave              varia
#       dead_circumflex         perispomeni
#       dead_diaeresis          dialytika
#       dead_caron              vrachy
#       dead_macron             makron
#       *dead_abovehook UEFD3   koronis
#       dead_invertedbreve      dasia
#       dead_breve              psili
#       dead_belowdot           ypogegrammeni/prosgegrammeni
#
#   Monotonic Greek is supported as a part of polytonic Greek, because tonos
#   can be emulated using oxia instead, as since 1986, acute is the official
#   tonos.
#   https://www.opoudjis.net/unicode/unicode_gkbkgd.html#oxia
#
#   However, for any eventuality, tonos as such is also supported, using
#   dead_doubleacute, on the "E" key D03, with additional alphabetic mnemonic
#   based on the initial of Elliniká:
#
#       dead_doubleacute        tonos

# # End note about polytonic Greek
#
#   Here ends the section dedicated to polytonic and monotonic Greek.
#   See ### Greek with diacritics
#
#   The Greek base alphabet for technical use is in the Latin dead key section,
#   where the Greek letter dead key also supports circled, consistently with
#   its multikey equivalent "@".
#   See #*# GREEK_OR_CIRCLED
#
#   As this file is part of a Latin keyboard layout, the polytonic Greek part
#   is documented in an extra table rather than in the regular table dedicated
#   to the Greek or circled dead key. Indeed, polytonic Greek is supported only
#   in an attempt to meet eventual user expectations raised by the extensive
#   dead key coverage, for completeness, for diplomatic reasons fostering an
#   undiscriminatory support policy, and with respect to the work ethos banning
#   half measures and lazy excuses for not doing the job. In the context of a
#   fully comprehensive coverage of Latin script, and given the fact that
#   polytonic Greek is part of our Western civilisation, unsupporting polytonic
#   Greek is not an option.
