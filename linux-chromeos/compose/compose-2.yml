### Dead keys
#
#   While on Windows and macOS, input composition can be emulated by chaining
#   dead keys, XKB is to emulate dead keys by input composition. This resulting
#   configuration file is very human readable, and it is easily converted into
#   documentation.
#   See # # Notes about documentation
#
#   Input composition implemented by chaining dead keys is more powerful in
#   that it supports modularity, as opposed to XCompose that requires listing
#   all supported sequences, verbatim and in extenso. The reason why is that
#   this does not work:
#
#       <dead_circumflex> <dead_circumflex> : dead_belowcircumflex
#
#   then:
#
#       <dead_belowcircumflex> <e>          : "ḙ" U1E19 # LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX BELOW
#
#   Although X.org specifies:
#
#       If the string is omitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according
#       to the current locale.
#
#       I.e., if a rule looks like:
#
#           <dead_grave>     <A> : "\300" Agrave
#
#       the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.
#       But if the rule is:
#
#           <dead_grave> <A> : Agrave
#
#       the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.

#
# # Notes on Unicode support
#
#   Support of the Latin script is up-to-date as of Unicode 17.0 (2025-09-09).
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode17.0.0/
#   https://github.com/dispoclavier/nouvel-azerty/releases/tag/6.0.4
#
#   The extended Latin F & G blocks in the SMP are supported since 2023-05-25.
#   https://unicode.org/versions/enumeratedversions.html
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-F
#
#   The issues related to SMP support do not affect Linux nor macOS, as opposed
#   to Windows, whose DEADTRANS macro only supports one single code unit output
#   instead of 2, 5 or more, and as a consequence, SMP characters are hard to
#   input by dead keys.
#
#   Due to more comprehensive support for Unicode characters used in Latin
#   script as encoded since version 1.1 of the Standard, some sequences in
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose need to be redefined, by making more extensive use
#   of ASCII symbols and punctuation.
#
#   With Multi_key thought of as a generic dead key taking arguments, the base
#   letter that those modifications are applied to is typed last. This pattern
#   empowers XCompose to apply multiple diacritics as used in Vietnamese and in
#   Lithuanian. Therefore, it performs much better than the other way around.
#
#   As a result, semantics of paired punctuation may be switched compared to
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose. For example, the multikey equivalent of dead_breve
#   in en_US.UTF-8/Compose is <Multi_key><a><parenleft>, while in new-school
#   input composition it is <Multi_key><parenright><a>.
#
#   This scheme is not proper to new school, since in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, we
#   already have a prepended "U" with shape-based mnemonic (<Multi_key><U><a>),
#   as well as a prepended initial: <Multi_key><b><a>.
#
#   While that change alone would not warrant a comprehensive overhaul, more
#   tweaks are required, such as supporting superscript and subscript, using
#   asciicircum and underscore repurposed, formerly circumflex and macron.
#
#   So, when "<" and ">" are used for circumflex and hacek (hatchek, caron)
#   and "|" for macron, ":" gets used for diaeresis like in Vim, and quotedbl
#   looks fine for double acute accent. A change that is the more desirable as
#   it supports the use of quotedbl as a base character for curly quotation
#   marks.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   Bottom line: Full Unicode support requires an upgraded multikey scheme,
#   called "new-school input composition" for the purpose.
#
#
# # Introducing new-school input composition
#
#   New-school composition is designed to fully support the Latin script. This
#   requires repurposing several ASCII symbols, so that en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#   ends up disrupted, breaking user experience. Such a step is taken only
#   because it is unavoidable.
#
#   "^" and "_" need to be freed up for super- and subscript/smallcap, applying
#   the parentheses-breve scheme to circumflex and hacek, macron and diaeresis.
#   For example, new-school multikey sequences include « ¦^ » for superscript,
#   « ¦> » for hacek, « ¦< » for circumflex accent, « ¦| » for macron, « ¦: »
#   for diaeresis, « ¦" » for the double acute accent, an acute diaeresis.
#   That helps avoid conflicts with the dead key based input method for
#   apostrophe/comma-shaped double quotation marks.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   Another reason to adopt new-school is that in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, <comma>
#   is used for both dead_cedilla and dead_ogonek, resulting in a conflict on E
#   that en_US.UTF-8/Compose works around by using <cedilla> instead of <comma>
#   in the multikey sequences yielding U0228 and U0229. If <semicolon> were
#   used as the multikey equivalent of both dead_belowcomma and dead_ogonek,
#   the result would be yet another dead key merger, rightfully avoided in
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#   Yet another reason is that en_US.UTF-8/Compose, using dead_hook both for
#   hook and hook above, is unable to support "Ƴ" U01B3 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y
#   WITH HOOK and "ƴ" U01B4 LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH HOOK, proving the
#   existing scheme as impracticable.
#
#
# # Multikey equivalents
#
#   Following the example of en_US.UTF-8/Compose, dead keys are emulated by
#   multikey for a versatile user experience at levels 1..3, despite dead keys
#   are extensively supported at level 4 with a number of level-1/3 duplicates.
#
#   Only a subset of the dead key content, however, is supported by multikey,
#   due to numerous conflicts, such as with the superscript or subscript dead
#   keys, with the quotation mark input method, with math symbols. Conflicting
#   multikey equivalents are commented out, with an enumeration of conflicting
#   characters, and eventually with a comment in the dead key header.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#   See #   Conflictlessness check
#   See #   Multikey conflicts with
#
#   Multikey equivalents for math symbols supported by dead key for consistency
#   are prone to conflicts with mnemonic multikey sequences provided as part of
#   the math symbol support, that have precedence over multikey equivalents,
#   for completeness of the math symbol documentation.
#   See ### Mathematical symbols by multikey
#   See #   Multikey is supported as part of math symbols.
#   See # # Notes about documentation
#
#   Extended dead key support — beyond the feasible multikey support level — is
#   required to make sure that dead keys are usable to an acceptable extent, so
#   as to avoid an excessive number of failures and disappointments, and foster
#   wide adoption motivated by the observation of usability and adequacy.
#
#   The resulting inconsistencies due to dead key sequences without a supported
#   multikey equivalent require transpiling multikey sequences separately, as
#   opposed to connecting the dead keys to a similar number of multikey entry
#   points, as it is straightforward when manually configuring the dead keys
#   on Windows.
#
#   Most multikey equivalents below the dead key sequences have been added by
#   the script generate-multikey.pl.

#
# # X11 dead keysyms
#
#   The dead keysyms defined in keysymdef.h, that is part of x11proto-core-dev,
#   are so defective that the Latin script cannot be fully supported without
#   private use area keysyms. The most outstanding example is the lack of a
#   keysym for the bar diacritic, thought of as horizontal, as opposed to
#   the diagonal stroke.
#   See # # Bar and stroke diacritics
#
#   Here are the dead keysyms for Latin keyboard layouts configured in
#   keysymdef.h. The 21 dead keysyms used in this file are checked:
#
#      dead_abovecomma
#    ✔ dead_abovedot
#      dead_abovereversedcomma
#    ✔ dead_abovering
#    ✔ dead_acute
#      dead_belowbreve
#      dead_belowcircumflex
#    ✔ dead_belowcomma
#      dead_belowdiaeresis
#    ✔ dead_belowdot
#      dead_belowmacron
#      dead_belowring
#      dead_belowtilde
#    ✔ dead_breve
#    ✔ dead_caron
#    ✔ dead_cedilla
#    ✔ dead_circumflex
#    ✔ dead_currency
#    ✔ dead_diaeresis
#    ✔ dead_doubleacute
#      dead_doublegrave
#    ✔ dead_grave
#    ✔ dead_greek
#    ✔ dead_hook
#    ✔ dead_horn
#    ✔ dead_invertedbreve
#    ✔ dead_macron
#    ✔ dead_ogonek
#    ✔ dead_stroke
#    ✔ dead_tilde
#
#   Some new dead keys already had a keysym defined in keysymdef.h, then got it
#   removed as documented below:
#
#      dead_aboveverticalline
#      dead_belowverticalline
#      dead_longsolidusoverlay
#      dead_lowline
#
#
# # Bar and stroke diacritics
#
#   Despite for line-shaped diacritics crossing the letters, the slant of the
#   line is semantically significant, they are interchangeably referred to as
#   “stoke”, eventually with the attribute “diagonal”. Fortunately, in Unicode,
#   the horizontal line is often called “bar”.
#
#   As of the keysym, in X11 keysymdef.h, dead_stroke was initially meant to be
#   used both for the diagonal dash overlay and for the horizontal dash overlay
#   also known as bar. Yet in practice, one dead key is not enough to support
#   both "/"-shaped and "-"-shaped diacritics.
#
#   To cater for Karl Pentzlin’s new German T3 layout issued in DIN 2137:2012,
#   dead_longsolidusoverlay was added based on the name of the diacritic used
#   to decompose negated math symbols: "̸" U0338 COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY
#   (given that Oslash "Ø" U00D8 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH STROKE and similar
#   letters are not decomposed). T3 also required another three new keysyms:
#   dead_aboveverticalline, dead_belowverticalline, dead_lowline, although none
#   of these has any precomposed letters, and Windows’ DEADTRANS macro only
#   supports one single code unit output instead of 2, 5 or more, and as a
#   consequence, decomposed (NFD/NFKD) letters cannot be input by dead key like
#   precomposed letters. But the stroke vs bar distinction made a good point
#   for adding the “extra dead elements for German T3 layout” alongside the use
#   of vertical line below and its alternate representation vertical line above
#   in Yoruba and in other languages.
#
#   Initially, the new keysym was called "dead_longsolidus", and "dead_stroke"
#   was disruptively renamed to "dead_shortstroke" as well.
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=85370
#
#   Alas, en_US.UTF-8/Compose has not been updated in the wake. One decade down
#   the road, while dead_longsolidusoverlay was (expectedly) in use at least in
#   Cimbali’s partial implementation (skipping unsupported dead key content) of
#   the newly standardized (NF Z71-300) French AZERTY https://norme-azerty.fr/
#   in /usr/share/X11/symbols/fr(afnor), that explicitly supports "Ł" U0141 and
#   "ł" U0142 as well as "Ƚ" U023D and "ƚ" U019A (another casing letter pair is
#   less completely enumerated in the standard), Ghost User (@ghost) managed to
#   toss it out of keysymdef.h.

#   The resulting regression was bluntly released in libxkbcommon 1.6.0.

#
#   Consistently, in Cimbali’s French AFNOR layout, dead_longsolidusoverlay
#   ended up as a second instance of dead_stroke, and none of the two French
#   standard layouts could be implemented anymore using XKB named keysyms only.
#
#   Fortunately, that was just a ghost in a mismanaged branch that did not make
#   it into main, given that in 2024 versions, the new keysyms are still there.
#   https://fossies.org/linux/tk/xlib/X11/keysymdef.h
#   https://web.archive.org/web/20241002235635/https://fossies.org/linux/tk/xlib/X11/keysymdef.h
#
#   Consistently, in version tk8.6.15 (2024-11-27), new advice has been added,
#   urging to not remove any keysyms (line 168).
#   https://fossies.org/diffs/tk/8.6.14_vs_8.6.15/xlib/X11/keysymdef.h-diff.html
#
#   The outcome is that in the meantime, due to fooling into assuming that the
#   changes were effective, the instances of dead_longsolidusoverlay have been
#   replaced with dead_stroke, and *dead_bar has been assigned UEFD8, the ninth
#   Private Use Area keysym used for regular dead keys in this file, resulting
#   in more consistency of dead keysyms with names of diacritics.
#   See # # Proposed additional dead keysyms
#
#
# # Macron below and line below
#
#   The deadkeysym dead_lowline is not used to input precomposed letters having
#   “WITH LINE BELOW” in their name, given that in the "Latin Extended
#   Additional" block, “the names "WITH LINE BELOW" refer to a macron below the
#   letter.”
#   https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_1E00.html
#
#   These letters are input using dead_belowmacron, which may be virtualized by
#   double press of dead_macron.
#   See #^# MACRON_BELOW
#
#   Letters with a real line below are used in languages of Gabon and in Oneida
#   and require a line-below dead key, standardized in ISO/IEC 9995-11, where
#   dead keys output combining diacritics to begin with, for post-processing by
#   applications on Windows that part 11 of the standard has been designed for.
#   See #^# LINE_BELOW
#
#   As the output only consists in an added combining diacritic to any letter
#   typed after, implementing this dead key on non-Windows keyboards requires
#   knowing the list of letters expected to be supported.
#
#   (Although U0332 COMBINING LOW LINE is defined as connecting, it may not be
#   used to underline a text span in plain text, due to vertical alignment
#   issues under lowercase letters with descender.)
#
#
# # Hook, hook above and retroflex hook
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, dead_hook is used both for hook and hook above.
#   The consequence is that en_US.UTF-8/Compose is unable to support "Ƴ" U01B3
#   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH HOOK and "ƴ" U01B4 LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH
#   HOOK alongside "Ỷ" U1EF6 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH HOOK ABOVE and
#   "ỷ" U1EF7 LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH HOOK ABOVE.
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, the question mark is used as a multikey equivalent
#   of hook above, while the many letters with hook that are supported ("Ɓ",
#   "ɓ", "Ƈ", "ƈ", "Ɗ", "ɗ", "Ƒ", "ƒ", "Ɠ", "ɠ", "ɦ", "Ƙ", "ƙ", "Ɱ", "ɱ", "Ɲ",
#   "ɲ", "Ƥ", "ƥ", "ʠ", "ɼ", "ʂ", "Ƭ", "ƭ", "Ʋ", "ʋ", "Ⱳ", "ⱳ", "Ȥ", "ȥ") are
#   so by dead key only (dead_hook), without any multikey equivalent.
#
#   Hence the need for a keysym dedicated to letters with hook above. The most
#   obvious is *dead_abovehook. As of its multikey equivalent, bracketright is
#   more convenient than question.
#
#   Another hook dead key is added because new-school input composition uses
#   braceleft as a multikey equivalent of dead_hook, while taking advantage of
#   the brace symmetry to alleviate the overloaded dead_hook, by adding the new
#   *dead_retroflexhook dead key, with braceright as a multikey equivalent.
#
#
# # Proposed additional dead keysyms
#
#   These 8 additional dead keys are required for supporting the Latin script,
#   and also for consistency with the 30 ASCII symbols and punctuation mapped
#   at level 3 of the keys in rows B..D, columns 1..10.

#
# # Dead keys not included in keysymdef.h
#
#   As these dead keys are required on these fr-FR keyboard layouts, and while

#   used so far instead, with mnemonic numbers to palliate the lack of mnemonic
#   dead keysyms.

#   See # # Dead characters for portability
#
#   0 is for the group dead key, 1 is for superscript, and 2 is for subscript,
#   given that these three are both the most outstanding and the most obvious
#   new dead keys; 3 has the form of a hook above; 4 has a flection to the left
#   making it mnemonic for retroflex; 5 remains readable after it is turned;
#   7 looks close to a flag; and 8 has lines converging at the exact location
#   of the bar crossing barred letters. The least mnemonic is 6 for reversed.

# # Order of dead key lists
#
#   There is no obvious order for the dead keys, since keysyms may be missing,
#   most code points are arbitrary and unmnemonic, and using common names for
#   that purpose is challenging due to language and conventions.
#
#   By lack of anything better, dead keys are ordered following the keyboard
#   layout as in the list below.
#   See #   Dead key layout overview
#
#   That order is based on the assumption that those ASCII symbols are mapped
#   in a stable manner. However, prior to v2, this ASCII map was unstable.
#   See Compose.yml Acknowledgements
#
#
# # Proposed dead key layout for AZERTY keyboards
#
#   30 out of 32 ASCII symbols and punctuation are mapped at level 3 of keys
#   (B..D)(01..10), and 28 dead keys are mapped at level 4 on the same keys
#   as the ASCII characters used to emulate those dead keys by multikey, using
#   old-school or new-school input composition as appropriate on a case-by-case
#   basis.
#   See # # Introducing new-school input composition
#
#   One of those two dead keys that is not mapped on the same key as the symbol
#   used to emulate it by multikey is dead_abovedot, mapped on key "P", where
#   level-3 ampersand is unrelated. However, dead_abovedot’s multikey
#   equivalent period is mapped at level 5, for use as a decimal separator or
#   group separator on the level-5 numpad, alongside comma on key C10 "M" on
#   AZERTY.
#
#   The other exception is dead_cedilla on the "comma" key B07, where level 3
#   is used for question mark, that is not an equivalent of any dead key
#   either.
#
#   As a result, most dead keys are mnemonically related to the ASCII symbols
#   mapped on the same keys, the more as all level-4 positions are available
#   for dead keys, because none of them is used for an uppercase letter, the
#   less as in the Windows implementation of these layouts, the UX level 3
#   called AltGr is an additional level, implemented as 0x10 or Right Oyayubi.
#   It is no longer emulated by Control + Alt. As a consequence, it has no
#   Caps Lock support, but it is free from the numerous conflicts with
#   application shortcuts affecting the (Shift-plus-)Control-plus-Alt "AltGr"

# # Virtual dead keys
#
#   The French BÉPO ergonomic keyboard layout defines a number of dead keys as
#   virtualized by dead key double press.
#   https://bepo.fr/wiki/Version_1.1rc1/Touches_mortes/Pressions_multiples
#
#   The diacritics supported by double-press virtual dead keys are doubled or
#   transformed by shifting to the less frequently diacriticized side of the
#   letter.
#
#   Based on this, triple or quadruple press virtual dead keys may also be
#   supported as required. Additionally, mixing multiple diacritics on the
#   same letter also requires virtual dead keys.
#
#
# # Single-character dead keys
#
#   Some virtual dead keys exist for the sake of one single letter, and so
#   offer the opportunity to be streamlined by cropping the base character.
#   See #   As this dead key exists for
#
#   As a result, the letter is output as soon as the dead key combination is
#   complete, without waiting for the base character, given the lack of
#   multiple options.
#   See # # SUPERSCRIPT&SUBSCRIPT&BAR
#   See # # COMBINING_ABOVE&CEDILLA
#   See # # SUPERSCRIPT&STROKE
#
#   One multikey equivalent, however, is not included in the scheme, because it
#   conflicts with the math symbol "⟌" U27CC and thus requires the base letter
#   as a terminator.
#   See # # SUPERSCRIPT&SUBSCRIPT&BREVE_BELOW
#
#   This feature is part of the streamlined user experience set as an implicit
#   design goal.
#   See #   Streamlining
#   See # # Lenient dead key press
#
#
#   Single-diacritic dead keys
#
#   Another category of single-character dead keys is required to support the
#   combining diacritic glyphs made out of multiple diacritics in a row. Many
#   of these characters are new to Unicode 17.0.
#   https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-17.0/U170-1AB0.pdf
#
#   These dead keys require the space base character (either U0020 or U200B) as
#   a terminator and thus work like normal dead keys, without any streamlining,
#   except as set up for lenient dead key press.
#   See # # Lenient dead key press
#
#
# # Input order of mixed dead keys
#
#   Dead key combinations, called chained dead keys on Windows, are actionable
#   both ways for two diacritics, except when order matters, for diacritics to
#   be positioned above, stacked in one order or the other way around, as for
#   "Ṻ" U1E7A and "ṻ" U1E7B versus "Ǖ" U01D5 and "ǖ" U01D6, the only case, for
#   instance. All other dead key combinations are symmetric and are symmetrized
#   consistently, multikey equivalents not withstanding.
#   See # # Plus minus
#   See # # MACRON&DIAERESIS
#   See # # DIAERESIS&MACRON
#   See # # Multikey equivalents
#
#
# # Symmetrization of chained dead keys
#
#   Chained dead keys may be symmetrized using the "bhughes339.replacerules"
#   extension for VSCode with this replaceruleset based on the observation that
#   at this point, chaining does not encompass more than four dead key strokes
#   other than group selection, that always trails and is thus not symmetrized.
#   The JSON below going into user settings has the "@" prefix for subsequent
#   multikey equivalent generation built in and supports a number of likely
#   use cases.

# # Lenient dead key press
#
#   When dead keys are chained, dead keys virtualized by multiple press may be
#   abbreviated to single press so as to streamline the user experience.
#   See #   Lenient dead key press
#   See # # INVERTED&CURL
#
#   When the scheme applies to the group dead key, it is called “lenient group
#   selection” for clarity.
#   See #   Lenient group selection
#
#   Where diacritical or transformational dead keys are chained with the group
#   dead key, empty lower groups are used for redundant mappings of characters
#   expected in higher groups, so as to not require activating the exact group.
#
#   This is part of the streamlined, “un-screwed-up” user experience set as an
#   implicit design goal.

#
# # Quotation mark input method
#
#   A complete set of current curly quotes is input on unshifted keys, thanks
#   to the fact that both the involved dead keys and the base characters have
#   base level mappings.
#
#   This is part of the dead key enhancement based on considering each dead key
#   a group selector activating the "<dead key> group": "circumflex group", or
#   "dead_circumflex group".
#
#   Common quotation marks:
#
#       Circumflex:   turned high    opening or closing   U2018, U201C
#       See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#       Acute accent: high           closing or opening   U2019, U201D
#       See #*# ACUTE
#
#       Diaeresis:    low            opening              U201A, U201E
#       See #*# DIAERESIS
#
#   Additionally, some rare quotation marks are also supported, with a dead key
#   that is not at the base level:
#
#       Grave accent: reversed high  opening              U201B, U201F
#       See #*# GRAVE
#
#       Double grave, or diaeresis + grave:    reversed low      U2E42
#       See #^# DOUBLE_GRAVE
#       See # # DIAERESIS&GRAVE
#
#   This input method is fostered by using dead_doubleacute, consistently with
#   ASCII double quote replaced with EuroSign on key D03, level 3. This dead
#   key prevents conflicts by not having many base characters.
#   See #*# DOUBLE_ACUTE
#
#   So it is by supporting rightsinglequotemark as a base character, to account
#   for the replacement of the ASCII apostrophe on key E04 with the typographic
#   apostrophe to enhance UX, although the ASCII apostrophe is on an unshifted
#   key again — either E12 on the base layout, or E07 on the remapped variant,
#   to account for its extensive usage, both in wiki syntax and in article text
#   according to Wikipedia’s Manual of Style — and is thus supported as a base
#   character, too.

#   Alternative multikey support
#
#   Conflicting multikey equivalents as part of the quotation mark support by
#   dead keys are commented out according to the related policy.
#   See # # Multikey equivalents
#
#   Conflicts are due to CIRCUMFLEX&ACUTE, as <Multi_key><less><apostrophe>
#   for "‘" U2018 conflicts with "Ấ" U1EA4, "ấ" U1EA5, "Ế" U1EBE, "ế" U1EBF,

#   for "‚" U201A conflicts with "Ǘ" U01D7, "ǘ" U01D8, "Ḯ" U1E2E, "ḯ" U1E2F,
#   "ΐ" U1FD3, "ΰ" U1FE3, "΅" U1FEE; but not to Greek dialytika tonos in the
#   dead key GREEK_OR_CIRCLED&DIAERESIS&DOUBLEACUTE, as conflicting multikey
#   equivalents in this dead key are commented out to prevent conflicts with
#   <Multi_key><colon><at><quotedbl> and <Multi_key><colon><at><EuroSign> for
#   "„" U201E. (This only affects "̈́" U0344, "΅" U0385, "ΐ" U0390, "ΰ" U03B0.)
#   See # # GREEK_OR_CIRCLED&DIAERESIS&DOUBLEACUTE
#
#   To palliate the resulting lack of multikey support, the affected set of
#   most current apostrophe-and-comma-shaped quotation marks is supported by
#   another facility.

#
# # Spacing modifier letters and clones of diacritics
#
#   An input method based on overtyping reportedly existed on very old systems.
#   Most of the spacing diacritics in Latin-1 were replaced with letters in
#   Latin-15, but other symbols were replaced too, while a diacritic remained.
#
#   The Unicode Standard states in §7.9 that it is not clear whether diacritics
#   were combining or standalone. Using the latter as dead characters (Windows)
#   or terminators (macOS) in dead keys is not possible consistently throughout
#   and is a reason why many keyboard layouts are not streamlined, and dead key
#   behavior is inconsistent. The most outstanding example is a dedicated "ê"
#   key, when "ê" is better supported by configuring the circumflex accent dead
#   key accordingly, with "ê" U00EA as a dead character. Other examples include
#   unrelated dead characters for hook and horn and for almost all chained dead
#   keys.
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#   See #*# HOOK
#   See #*# HORN
#
#   Unicode added U02D8..U02DD to the Latin-1 diacritics merely for roundtrip
#   compatibility with pre-existing character sets.
#
#   Both NBSP (AltGr + spacebar) and NBTSP (AltFr + spacebar) are used as base
#   characters.
#
#   Since DIAERESIS and CEDILLA do exist only in Latin-1, they are accessible
#   both ways. By contrast, Latin-1 MACRON and ACUTE ACCENT are duplicates of
#   modifier letters (by NBTSP) and are accessible by NBSP exclusively. Then,
#   ASCII symbols GRAVE ACCENT, CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT, TILDE are included as well.
#
#
# # Dead characters for portability
#
#   On Windows, each dead key has a mandatory and unique dead character through
#   which it exists in the C source, while on MacOS, dead keys have arbitrary
#   identifiers, and the optional character related to a dead key is merely a
#   UX feature called terminator. Both OSes output it when the base character
#   is not listed with the current dead key, prior to outputting the unchanged
#   base character itself. XCompose, by contrast, has no output in this case.
#
#   Traditionally, this character is output in isolation on hitting space after
#   a dead key, but space is now reserved for the related combining diacritic,
#   and this is inappropriate as a dead character, because dead characters must
#   be spacing so as to be clearly distinguishable and keep user experience on
#   a correct level, also with respect to the use on macOS of these characters
#   as terminators displayed on a yellow background during an ongoing sequence,
#   and in support of the new XKB feature displaying underlined dead characters
#   picked in a system file, as opposed to Windows not providing any feedback.
#
#   Yet, many diacritics do not have any spacing clone to be picked as a dead
#   character or terminator. By contrast, picking the dead character from the
#   dead key output is universal.
#
#   The topmost reason for picking the dead character from the dead key output
#   is that an "Ê" key emulation on the circumflex accent dead key requires "ê"
#   as a dead character in dead_circumflex, and so does the "Ç" key emulation
#   require "ç" in dead_cedilla. But this is limited to Windows.
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#   See #*# CEDILLA
#
#   For dead_tilde, the dead character base letter is "e" for consistency with
#   dead_belowtilde, that is precomposed only with e, i, u, and for equity, as
#   opposed to picking one of ã, ñ, õ, and thus favoring either Portuguese or
#   Spanish. The ẽ also makes for a consistent mnemonic since tilde ends in e.
#   See #*# TILDE
#   See #^# MIDDLE_TILDE
#
#   For portability, the dead characters are defined in the dead key headings:
#
#       #*# SUPERSCRIPT
#       #   *dead_superscript UEFD1
#       #   Multi_key: ¦^
#       #   Dchar: "^" U005E
#
#   A projected transpiler shall read in this dead character and use it for the
#   DEADTRANS macro invocations on Windows, supporting an implementable subset
#   (no strings). That is yet to be implemented (idea 2023-11-06T0603+0100).
#
#   For documentation, a list of dead character candidates is provided here.
#   For natively unsupported dead keys, a keysym candidate is proposed as well.

#
#   The multikey sequences by contrast are built using generic dead characters
#   in a private use area, because there are too many of them, and it is better
#   to have a .notdef box output on failure rather than an unintended character
#   or two of them (on Windows).
#
#   Moreover, chained dead keys require as many dead characters as dead keys
#   involved. As a result, support for this scheme is about to be dropped.
#
#
# # Combining diacritics
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, combining diacritics are supported using the base
#   character nobreakspace, while space yields a legacy spacing character if
#   available (not for dead_hook, dead_belowcomma, dead_doubleacute properly).
#
#   Those among these spacing characters that are in the ASCII range, as "^",
#   "~", "`", are not usefully generated by dead key. These are expected to be
#   easily accessible on live keys instead.
#
#   Hence it is proposed to use space as a base character to get the combining
#   diacritic throughout, as implemented since 2010 on J. ‘Mach’ Wust’s 
#   US Custom keyboard layout for macOS:
#   http://uscustom.sourceforge.net/
#
#   Indeed the Unicode Standard version 11.0.0, section 5.2, page 220 states:
#
#      A common implementation for the input of combining character sequences
#      is the use of dead keys. These keys match the mechanics used by
#      typewriters to generate such sequences through overtyping the base
#      character after the nonspacing mark. In computer implementations,
#      keyboards enter a special state when a dead key is pressed for the
#      accent and emit a precomposed character only when one of a limited
#      number of “legal” base characters is entered. It is straightforward
#      to adapt such a system to emit combining character sequences or
#      precomposed characters as needed.
#
#      Typists, especially in the Latin script, are trained on systems that
#      work using dead keys. However, many scripts in the Unicode Standard
#      (including the Latin script) may be implemented according to the
#      handwriting sequence, in which users type the base character first,
#      followed by the accents or other nonspacing marks (see Figure 5-4).
#
#   As a result, keyboard layouts should feature dead keys as well as easy
#   access to combining marks. Alternative input method for combining marks:
#   https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/Phonetic_symbols__diacritics.html
#
#   Following a principle used in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, the most synergistic
#   character after the default mappings of dead keys at level 4, ZWSP,
#   duplicates the combining diacritics, much like conversely, the NBSP is
#   repurposed to yield spacing diacritics as does en_US.UTF-8/Compose with
#   ordinary space.
#
#   "¤" U00A4 # CURRENCY SIGN is an exception to the rule.
#
#   Except composed letters used for languages in Togo, composed letters are
#   not listed separately any more, since they were moved to the related dead
#   keys.
#   See # # Composed letters for languages in Togo
#
#   The XCompose compiler does not parse results defined as multiple keysyms.
#   Composed letters must be defined as literal strings without keysyms.
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, the only composed Latin letter is the uppercase and
#   lowercase "j" with acute accent by dead_acute or by multikey with prepended
#   or appended ASCII apostrophe or Latin-1 acute:
#
#       "J́"   # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER J U004A with COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT U0301
#       "j́"   # LATIN SMALL LETTER J U006A with COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT U0301
#
#   Due to a technical limitation on Windows (the DEADTRANS macro only supports
#   one single code unit output instead of 2, 5 or more), dead keys on Windows
#   are limited to single UTF-16 code units, excluding composed letters and
#   characters in the Supplemental Multilingual Plane. Hence, composed letters
#   are not cross-platform compatible.
#
#
# # Enumeration order of dead keys
#
#   Dead keys in this file are ordered following the AZERTY keyboard layout.
#   See # # Actionable dead key layout for Latin keyboards
#
#   Heading levels are differentiated, in that the main dead keys with mappings
#   on keys are prefixed "#*# ", the dead keys virtualized by double or triple,
#   rarely quadruple press are prefixed "#^# ", and the other dead keys "# # ".
#
#   Dead keys are further ordered following this scheme:
#
#       1.    #*# Main dead key
#       2.    # # Dead key in group
#       3.    # # Dead key combination with one or more other dead keys
#       4.    #^# Dead key virtualized by multiple press
#
#   The order of base characters matters, too, since this file is also used for
#   documentation: spaces, quotedbl, apostrophes, other symbols and punctuation
#   where ASCII is intuitively ordered consistently with the dead keys, while
#   non-ASCII aliases are grouped with their ASCII counterparts; digits are
#   next, then the base alphabet, and ultimately diacriticized letters on live
#   keys.
#   See # # Order of dead key lists
#
#   As a result, combining marks and spacing clones of diacritics are listed
#   first, quotation marks come next.

# # Composed letters for languages in Togo
#
#   This is based on the list that Mats Blakstad <mats.gbproject_at_gmail.com>
#   shared on the Unicode public mailing list in 2016.
#   “Possible to add new precomposed characters for local language in Togo?”
#   https://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2016-m02/0071.html
#
#   Sequences with Ɛ, ɛ and Ɔ, ɔ keysyms are for use on the Francophone Africa
#   semiautomatic keyboard layout “kbfrAFs” and its remapped variant “kbfrAFsr”
#   that have live keys for open e, also known as Latin epsilon, and open o.
#
#   For a streamlined user experience, regular base letters in groups 1..3 are
#   supported alongside the following shortcut base letters, listed with their
#   regular alternatives:
#
#       Output    Input group 1    group 2    group 3
#
#       "Ɛ" U0190       X          E
#       "ɛ" U025B       x          e
#       "Ŋ" U014A       G          N
#       "ŋ" U014B       g          n
#       "Ɔ" U0186       C          O
#       "ɔ" U0254       c          o
#       "Ʋ" U01B2       U                     V
#       "ʋ" U028B       u                     v
#
#   Consistently, the base letters in this list must match those in the letter
#   groups.
#   See #+# GROUP_1
#   See #+# GROUP_2
#   See #+# GROUP_3
#
#   Thanks to conflictlessness, the group dead key press may be skipped in some
#   instances, although it is supported throughout for consistency. Especially
#   for V WITH HOOK "Ʋ" U01B2, "ʋ" U028B with diacritics, group 1 of "V", "v"
#   is also supported, while plain group 1 is VERSICLE "℣" U2123.
#   See #   VERSICLE and RESPONSE
#   See # # Lenient dead key press
#
#   As this file is also the source code for documentation, the order in which
#   sequences are listed matters in that the most streamlined ones need to be
#   listed first, before coming to the regular, more tedious sequences, that
#   should be sorted by ascending complexity likewise.
#   See # # Notes about documentation
#
#   "M" and "m" with grave accent, included in the shared list, are moved to
#   dead_grave for consistency.
#   See #*# GRAVE
#
#   "Ǝ" U018E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER REVERSED E is called by its Unicode 1.0 name
#   "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER TURNED E" in this list, since it is the capital of
#   "ǝ" U01DD LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED E, not "ɘ" U0258 LATIN SMALL LETTER
#   REVERSED E.
#
#   Many Latin letters did not make it into keysymdef.h. Examples include
#   U0190 (*Eopen), U025B (*eopen), U0186 (*Oopen), U0254 (*oopen).

#   In Unicode CLDR, French has ordinal indicators ᵈ, ᵉ, ʳ, ˢ since v34 (2018).

#
#   Superscript lowercase letters are most extensively used as abbreviation
#   indicators in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, spoken by one
#   third of the world’s population. Therefore, these letters are on live keys.
#   Support for diacriticized abbreviation indicators is straightforward in the
#   Unicode character encoding model, using combining diacritics.
#   See #^# Legacy ordinal indicators
#
#   Superscript small q is part of Unicode since v14.0 released in 2020.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20117-modifier-letter-suppt.pdf
#   There had been an attempt to encode superscript q in isolation, with a good
#   rationale based on two street signs photographed in Paris, pointing to the
#   National Library: “Biblio𐞥ᵘᵉ Nationale”.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2010/10230-modifier-q.pdf
#   One year later, in 2011, a new take argued that the full set of superscript
#   small and capital letters is convenient for keyboard layout design, as this
#   would improve the related user experience.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2011/11208-n4068.pdf
#   The first proposal encountered strong headwinds from the industry.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2010/10315-comment.pdf
#   It was immediately defended by its author during the UTC meeting.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2010/10316-cmts.pdf
#   Both attempts to complete the Latin superscript small letters failed.
#
#   The superscript uppercase alphabet is less complete. Yet some of these are
#   used in orthographies. In 2020 and 2021, more uppercase letters were added:
#   C "ꟲ" UA7F2, F "ꟳ" UA7F3, Q "ꟴ" UA7F4.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20251-mod-latin.pdf
#   L2/20-251 is cited in the Script Ad Hoc Working Group Report L2/21-016r.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2021/21016r-script-adhoc-rept.pdf
#   In 2025, with version 17.0, uppercase S "꟱" UA7F1 was added too.

#
#   Superscript uppercase X, Y, Z still missing despite a proposal advising to
#   encode them all are for now replaced with "∄" U2204 THERE DOES NOT EXIST.

#   See #*# SUBSCRIPT
#
#   There is a consensus about including superscript letters in Unicode for
#   phonetic notation. But plain text abbreviation indicators are fiercely
#   opposed by members of the Consortium, for software marketing reasons. And
#   when character names on a MODIFIER LETTER basis were introduced, these were
#   adopted as the new norm for “superscript”. Meanwhile, “subscript” remained
#   unchanged, meaning that duly disguising subscript likewise was dropped,
#   probably due to running out of technical terms. That makes clear that the
#   preformatted superscript letters were targeted in particular, due to their
#   use as abbreviation indicators, since superscript is a means to carry
#   semantics and is therefore eligible for plain text support in Unicode.
#
#   Followed by quotedbl, EuroSign, apostrophe or rightsinglequotemark,
#   dead_superscript yields high curly quotation marks U201D, U2019 (closing or
#   opening) exactly like dead_acute does, and dead_tilde as of "”" U201D, for
#   more resilient keyboard layouts.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   Followed by asterisk, *dead_superscript provides an intuitive shortcut for 
#   "⁂" U2042 ASTERISM, with mnemonics based on the ASCII circumflex, no longer
#   the multikey equivalent of dead_circumflex, that "⁂" U2042 is also in.
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   To populate the diacritic slot, "̅" U0305 COMBINING OVERLINE is included,
#   with a mnemonic referring to "̲" U0332 COMBINING LOW LINE that fills this
#   slot in *dead_subscript, rather than duplicates of the set of circumflexes
#   already provided in dead_circumflex.
#   See #*# SUBSCRIPT
#
#   Consistently, the spacing clone is "‾" U203E, supported on live key, too.
#   See dispocla.cpp ## Overscore
#
#   The multikey equivalent of "⁻" U207B conflicts with "ᴯ" U1D2F, "ᶤ" U1DA4,
#   "ᶧ" U1DA7, "ᶱ" U1DB1, "ᶶ" U1DB6, "ꟸ" UA7F8, "𐞕" U10795, "𐞳" U107B3 and
#   "𐞴" U107B4, but this can be worked around by typing it the other way around
#   instead. The same holds true for "⁺" U207A conflicting with "⨣" U2A23, and
#   for "⁾" U207E conflicting with "𐞛" U1079B, "𐞜" U1079C, "𐞝" U1079D,
#   "𐞡" U107A1.

#   This is based on the small cap semantics of the subscript dead key.
#
#   The fraction slash is supported alongside as a workaround for incomplete
#   keyboard layouts lacking a live key position for U2044. The superscript or
#   subscript dead keys alone cannot include a slash as a base character due to
#   numerous conflicts with math symbols. Other input methods are included in
#   the slash-shaped set supported by dead_stroke, in slot 4, and in multikey.

#
#   This is required for the many letter-shaped diacritics that can be placed
#   above Latin letters.
#
#   Since all combining capital letters above are small caps, the capital slots
#   are used for these, and no extra virtual dead key is required.
#
#   The combining letter above with cedilla "ᷗ" U1DD7 is supported by its live
#   key on AZERTY, but for consistency, a virtual dead key is also provided.
#   See # # COMBINING_ABOVE&CEDILLA
#
#   As the three combining letters above with diaeresis "ᷲ" U1DF2, "ᷳ" U1DF3,
#   "ᷴ" U1DF4 do not intersect with small caps, the capital slots are used for
#   these too, for convenience, but for consistency, a combining above with
#   diaeresis virtual dead key is also provided. Additionally, live keys with
#   diaeresis are also supported.
#   See # # COMBINING_ABOVE&DIAERESIS
#
#   Some other combining characters above are supported likewise using empty
#   capital slots and base letters with a mnemonic shape:
#
#       S   "᷑" U1DD1 COMBINING UR ABOVE
#       T   "᷵" U1DF5 COMBINING UP TACK ABOVE
#       V   "᷃" U1DC3 COMBINING SUSPENSION MARK
#       X   "̽" U033D COMBINING X ABOVE
#       Z   "͛" U035B COMBINING ZIGZAG ABOVE
#
#   Additionally to the up tack, the other tacks are also supported since they
#   were added to Unicode for version 17.0. The base characters are digits 4, 6
#   and 0, along the lines of what is done for the spacing tacks "˔" U02D4,
#   "˕" U02D5, "꭪" UAB6A, "꭫" UAB6B in dead_tilde.

#   The rotation angle may be 180° as for TURNED, or 90° as for SIDEWAYS.
#
#   "ɟ" U025F LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS J WITH STROKE being “typographically a
#   turned f, but better thought of as a form of j” (Unicode Code Charts), for
#   consistency, it is supported as such, but for convenience also as a turned
#   f. Since the Claudian letter "Ⅎ" U2132 also has a lowercase form "ⅎ" U214E,
#   that is intended to meet Unicode casing requirements, the uppercase slot is
#   used for the related Lisu letter, and the set of Claudian letters is moved
#   to the double press dead key used for inverted, sideways and other turned.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudian_letters
#   See #^# INVERTED
#   See # # DOT_ABOVE&STROKE
#
#   Old Lisu letters are also supported, as they are repurposed for typesetting
#   turned Latin capital letters, also upright for centrally symmetric letters.
#   For an example see the “Propulsé par” (“Powered by”) mention at the bottom:
#   https://humanisme-renaissance.droz.org
#
#   Old Lisu has turned glyphs for A..L, N..P, R..V, X..Z because Q is not used
#   at all, and turned M and W are confusable. "𑾰" U11FB0 has been encoded late
#   and is therefore outside the BMP.

#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2018/18338r2-lisu-letter-yha.pdf
#
#   The TURNED dead key supports Lisu letters looking like turned Latin letters
#   or like the centrally symmetric H, I, N, O, S, X, Z since these may be used
#   alongside for consistency. But the other Lisu letters, those that cannot be
#   used as turned Latin letters, are not supported, given that this is not fit
#   for writing Lisu, due to its dead key based functioning. Still double press
#   is used for a fuller set.
#   See #^# INVERTED
#
#   Although "Ǝ" U018E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER REVERSED E is used as a turned E,
#   its usual glyph is a genuine reversed E for aesthetics, unlike what is done
#   for Lisu.
#   See #*# REVERSED
#
#   Turned punctuation for Spanish is supported both by turned (single press)
#   and inverted (double press) dead keys, to meet expectations based on names.
#
#   The opening parenthesis yields the character tie "⁀" U2040, since this may
#   be considered sideways, or like a vertical parenthesis. The undertie
#   "‿" U203F conflicts with "𐞡" U107A1, "𝼆" U1DF06 by its multikey equivalent,
#   but it is also supported in the double press virtual dead key. Both
#   "⁀" U2040 and "‿" U203F are also in group 12 of "(" and ")".

#
#   For intuitivity, the Polynesian ʻeta, Hawaiʻian ʻokina can also be input as
#   if it were a turned rightsinglequotemark despite being a letter. Apostrophe
#   is also supported as a base character for this input method.
#   See # # D07 apostrophe
#
#   As a diacritic, "̒" U0312 COMBINING TURNED COMMA ABOVE is included, and its
#   spacing counterpart "ʻ" U02BB MODIFIER LETTER TURNED COMMA alongside (but a
#   better option for typing a U02BB is using group 1 of grave), with no-break
#   space or no-break thin space as a base character.

#   This supports the full set of those among the Old Lisu letters that can be
#   used for writing in turned Latin letters, except "ꓞ" UA4DE, that is in the
#   single press dead key for the sake of using the uppercase slot of "ɟ" U025F
#   and making room for the Claudian letter "Ⅎ" U2132, that has a lowercase
#   form "ⅎ" U214E, intended to meet Unicode casing requirements, and thus less
#   appropriate for support in the single press *dead_turned, where "ɟ" U025F
#   is more convenient.
#   See #*# TURNED
#
#   The other Claudian letters are "Ↄ" U2183, "ↄ" U2184
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudian_letters
#   See #*# REVERSED
#   and "Ⱶ" U2C75, "ⱶ" U2C76.

#   Old Lisu does not turn the letters M, Q, W.
#
#   The two parentheses yield the two underties, one of which is inverted:
#   "⁔" U2054, "‿" U203F. For mnemonics, these are like sideways, or vertical
#   parentheses. "⁀" U2040 and "‿" U203F are also in group 12 of "(" and ")".
#   See # # C03 parenleft
#   See # # C04 parenright
#
#   As a diacritic, "̕" U0315 COMBINING COMMA ABOVE RIGHT is included, with the
#   rationale that turning twice may be used to represent a shift to the right.
#   Not "̓" U0313 COMBINING COMMA ABOVE, as this is supported in
#   dead_belowcomma double press.
#   See #^# COMMA_ABOVE
#
#   As a spacing clone, letter apostrophe "ʼ" U02BC is picked invariably.

#
#   This dead key, dedicated to what could be virtualized by dead_acute double
#   press, and supported by XKB, is required to prevent conflicts due to the
#   dead key based quotation mark input method.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   The DOUBLE_ACUTE dead key is also required for consistency with the symbols
#   mapped at level 3, and with the new-school multikey scheme mapping dead
#   keys and ASCII symbols except ampersand and question mark bijectively.
#   See # # Introducing new-school input composition
#
#   Multikey sequences with quotedbl are duplicated with EuroSign, to account
#   for the mapping of EuroSign instead of quotedbl for compliance with current
#   hardware and the European Commission’s recommendation, that is the purpose
#   of mapping quotedbl and dead_doubleacute on the "E" key (D04), rather than
#   braceleft and dead_hook (now on D08).
#   See dispocla.cpp ## Note about EURO SIGN
#
#   Double acute has no reported usage outside Unicode precomposed letters.
#   https://www.frathwiki.com/Double_Acute_Accent
#
#   With digits, dead_doubleacute acts as a shortcut for double circled numbers
#   with “double” mnemonic. Double arrows have their mnemonic redundancy on
#   *dead_flag.
#   See #^# DOUBLE_CIRCLED
#   See #*# FLAG
#
#   Double acute is chained with reversed for an emoji dead key that is located
#   after the symbol groups due to a file size restriction.

#   "Ǝ" U018E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER REVERSED E, "ɘ" U0258 LATIN SMALL LETTER
#   REVERSED E is no casing pair. The small letter has no capital letter, while
#   the capital letter is considered a turned "e", uppercase of "ǝ" U01DD LATIN
#   SMALL LETTER TURNED E. As such it is in the TURNED dead key, as well as in
#   group 1 of "E".

#   The two pilcrow bullets "⁌" U204C BLACK LEFTWARDS BULLET and "⁍" U204D
#   BLACK RIGHTWARDS BULLET are supported by case insensitive "b" and "d",
#   thanks to the fact that these lowercase letters are the reversed
#   counterpart of each other and would thus be missing from the reversed
#   dead key. The association with the pilcrow bullets is based on shape-driven
#   mnemonics using the rounded and straight parts of the bullets, coming close
#   to "¶" U00B6 PILCROW SIGN and "⁋" U204B REVERSED PILCROW SIGN, that is also
#   supported by remaining "p", and by "paragraph" (U00B6), key D10, level 7.
#
#   Digits yield mathematical backslashes. This is a part of the design of math
#   sequences.

#
#   "⦰" U29B0 is supported with braceright as a base character consistently
#   with the base character of "∅" U2205 in the symbol group 2.
#   See # # D09 braceright
#
#   "⮈" U2B88 is supported with underscore as a base character due to the
#   presence of "⮊" U2B8A in group 12 of underscore.
#
#   As a diacritic, "̔" U0314 COMBINING REVERSED COMMA ABOVE is included, along
#   with its spacing counterpart "ʽ" U02BD.

#   Lithuanian requires a hard dot on i and j. The sequences with dot above are
#   a workaround, since the hard dot on i and j is a feature of Lithuanian, and
#   should not depend on user input, but on font settings instead.
#
#   All letters annotated as for Lithuanian in this file are by courtesy of
#   Vilnius University, the State Commission of the Lithuanian language, 
#   Lithuanian Standards Board.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2012/12026r-n4191-lithuanian.pdf
#
#   The tilde dead key also has intuitive support for the swung dash "⁓" U2053,
#   with any of the remaining dashes U2013, U2015 as a base character, as well
#   as with underscore as an alternative ASCII base character.
#
#   As a convenience, "⁑" U2051 TWO ASTERISKS ALIGNED VERTICALLY is supported
#   by dead_tilde followed by asterisk, like "⁂" U2042 ASTERISM is in
#   *dead_circumflex, as both have easy mappings on the same key D11.
#
#   The tilde dead key supports the "”" U201D quotation mark, reduntantly
#   with acute accent, for more resilient keyboard layouts.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#
#   Daggers
#
#   The tilde dead key supports daggers, because its default position is mapped
#   on key "T" due to alphabetic mnemonic, while the "T"-shape-based mnemonic
#   benefits the daggers. The full set of daggers is available by digits 1..6
#   with shape-based mnemonic for simple, double and triple (already supported
#   by Umihotaru’s Nishiki-teki font) daggers, by 1..3, and numpad positional
#   mnemonic for left/right guard daggers, by 4 and 6 respectively, around the
#   turned dagger by 5.
#
#
#   Tacks
#
#   The remaining digits are used for the four tack modifier letters, still for
#   the sake of alphabetic-graphic mnemonics based on "T". These letters are
#   no superscripts despite the "modifier letter" part in their names. Mnemonic
#   is positional based on the numpad as far as possible in the remaining slots
#   7..9 based on the arrows of the numpad, and 0 based on semantics:
#
#      7    "꭪" UAB6A MODIFIER LETTER LEFT TACK
#      8    "˔" U02D4 MODIFIER LETTER UP TACK
#      9    "꭫" UAB6B MODIFIER LETTER RIGHT TACK
#      0    "˕" U02D5 MODIFIER LETTER DOWN TACK
#
#
#   Diacritics
#
#   The double diacritic "͠" U0360 has emdash as a mnemonic base character, and
#   dollar as an ASCII alternative with "double" mnemonics, for consistent
#   input methods across all dead keys featuring a double diacritic.
#
#   Combining tilde halves above – "︢" UFE22, "︣" UFE23 – are supported on all
#   fully available base letters for a streamlined user experience. Halves of
#   combining diacritics are also supported in a virtual dead key called
#   “tilde and ampersand”.
#   See # # TILDE&AMPERSAND
#
#
#   Math symbols
#
#   Consistently with other dead keys supporting diacriticized math symbols,
#   plus yields "⨤" U2A24, and numbersign yields "⧤" U29E4, without multikey
#   equivalents, but multikey support is provided as part of the math symbol
#   support.
#   See # # Supplemental Mathematical Operators of block U2A00
#   See # # Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-B of block U2980
#
#   Outline square brackets "⟦" U27E6, "⟧" U27E7 used in math are supported in
#   dead_tilde by "[" and "]" additionally to their support in dead_grave, to
#   work around the special formatting triggered by some ASCII-bracketed
#   strings in Markdown while the actual intent is to mark up keycaps in
#   documentation.

# # TILDE&AMPERSAND
#   Dchar: "ǂ" U01C2
#
#   This new virtual dead key uses the synergy of the dead_tilde main instance,
#   on key D11, level 3, with the ampersand on D10, level 3, according to the
#   new ASCII symbol map on alphabetic keys.
#
#   The TILDE&AMPERSAND dead key is partly dedicated to African click letters,
#   that hopefully come into the benefit of a consistent input method
#   additionally to their support in group 5 with another set of base letters.
#   See #+# GROUP_5
#
#   Three click letters have Latin equivalents in Zulu and are mapped on these
#   letters consistently, while another two use graphic mnemonics based on "O"
#   and on H, the latter thought of as sideways. These base letters are case
#   insensitive except q for intuitivity of the support for the superscript:
#
#       c  "ǀ" U01C0 LATIN LETTER DENTAL CLICK
#       x  "ǁ" U01C1 LATIN LETTER LATERAL CLICK
#       q  "ǃ" U01C3 LATIN LETTER RETROFLEX CLICK (post)alveolar click (IPA)
#       Q  "𐞹" U107B9 MODIFIER LETTER RETROFLEX CLICK WITH RETROFLEX HOOK
#
#       H  "ǂ" U01C2 LATIN LETTER ALVEOLAR CLICK  palatoalveolar click (IPA)
#       O  "ʘ" U0298 LATIN LETTER BILABIAL CLICK
#
#   Other parts of this dead key are dedicated to combining diacritics, with
#   the ampersand carrying the "combining" semantics.
#   See # # Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols used in mathematics
#
#   While the mnemonics based on ASCII symbols are obvious, the mnemonics based
#   on letters use a new-school French AZERTY and its ASCII symbol map on the
#   alphabetic keys and row-B punctuation keys B01..B10, C01..C10 and D01..D10,
#   except for the annuity diacritic "⃧" U20E7 mapped on case insensitive A.
#   The list has been reordered alphabetically for consistency, but it started
#   with D and F for opening and closing parentheses "᫁" U1AC1, "᫃" U1AC3,
#   "᫂" U1AC2, "᫄" U1AC4, using uppercase for above, lowercase for below.
#
#   Half macrons and tildes start on the keys that their multikey equivalents
#   "|" and "~" are on, for the variants above: "︤" UFE24, "︥" UFE25, "︢" UFE22
#   and "︣" UFE23. But for these, the semantics of uppercase/lowercase is used
#   for the left and right halves, with the rationale that uppercase carries
#   semantics of start when it is in titlecase position. The variants below are
#   on a letter whose key is below M or T on the keyboard: G for the half tilde
#   "︩" UFE29 and the half tilde "︪" UFE2A, N for the half macron "︫" UFE2B and
#   the half macron "︬" UFE2C. This assumes a French AZERTY, where M comes
#   after L, and N is the last letter in the row below the row that M is in.
#
#   The ligature halves below are on L: "︧" UFE27, "︨" UFE28, while those above
#   – "︠" UFE20, "︡" UFE21 – are on P, as the P key is nearly above the L key,
#   and it benefits from the ampersand mnemonic.
#
#   By contrast, the "᫇" U1AC7 and "᷹" U1DF9 diacritics use graphic mnemonics
#   on case insensitive W and U.
#
#   As of the combining diacritic, the pick is the most iconic of the already
#   supported combining diacritics, also matching the ampersand silhouette,
#   "⃤" U20E4 COMBINING ENCLOSING UPWARD POINTING TRIANGLE, and for the spacing
#   clone, "△" U25B3 WHITE UP-POINTING TRIANGLE as the closest spacing
#   counterpart.

#
#   This dead key results from the merger of tilde below and middle tilde. But
#   given that middle tilde with 14 letters (casing counted twice, "ɵ" U0275
#   included) outweighs tilde below with 6 letters, middle tilde makes the dead
#   key name.
#
#   The tilde below however keeps making the consistent combining and modifier
#   pair "̰" U0330, "˷" U02F7, while the combining tilde overlay "̴" U0334 is
#   supported by ampersand and by triple press.
#   See #^# DOUBLE_MIDDLE_TILDE
#
#   Lowercase of "Ɵ" U019F LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH MIDDLE TILDE is
#   "ɵ" U0275 LATIN SMALL LETTER BARRED O.
#   See #*# BAR
#
#   Combining tilde halves below – "︩" UFE29, "︪" UFE2A – are supported by all
#   fully available base letters for a streamlined user experience. Halves of
#   combining diacritics are also supported in a virtual dead key called
#   “tilde and ampersand”.

#
#   The Greek letter dead key is present on several layouts and supported by
#   XKB thanks to the French ergonomic BÉPO keyboard layout.
#   https://bepo.fr/wiki/Lettres_grecques
#   https://bepo.fr/wiki/Version_1.1rc2#Touches_mortes
#
#   The Greek dead key is mapped on D06 "Y" with a mnemonic based on "Greek I",
#   translating its French name: "i grec". As an exception to the rule that the
#   dead keys on alphabetic keys are at level 4, the Greek dead key is both at
#   level 4 and at level 3, given that its multikey equivalent "@" has a stable
#   level-1 position on E11 (both in French mode and in ASCII mode).
#
#   This ease of access is consistent with dead_greek’s potentially heavy use
#   for Greek letters and for circled digits, letters and symbols alike.
#
#   For Greek letters, group 6 provides an alternative input method.
#   See #+# GROUP_6
#
#   The Greek-to-Latin map conforms to ISO/IEC 9995-9 consistent with the Greek
#   keyboard layout.
#
#   When dead_greek was designed and added to en_US.UTF-8/Compose far ahead of
#   ISO/IEC 9995-9, mappings were not yet synced with the Greek keyboard. That
#   is the reason of the discrepancies between en_US.UTF-8/Compose and current
#   keyboard standards, like NF Z71-300:2019 in sync with ISO/IEC 9995-9:2016.

#       c : "ψ" (was "")
#       C : "Ψ" (was "")
#       j : "ξ" (was "θ")

#       y : "υ" (was "ψ")
#       Y : "Υ" (was "Ψ")
#
#   The empty place on Q is used for the theta symbol preferred in Romani when
#   only the glyph is considered, regardless of word processing concerns.
#
#   Greek subscript letters and small cap letters are also supported.
#   See # # GREEK_OR_CIRCLED&SUBSCRIPT
#
#   Polytonic Greek is supported alongside to meet eventual user expectations,
#   but due to file size restrictions, it cannot be included here. So, the
#   Greek overflow is in part 1.
#   See ### Greek with diacritics
#   See # # Notes for maintenance
#
#   The diacritic slot is used for the combining ypogegrammeni "ͅ" U0345 as the
#   most likely to be useful and expected, rather than other diacritical marks.
#   So is the spacing clone slot used for "ι" U1FBE rather than "ι" U03B9, that
#   is consistent with Greek encoding but is less expected in this place.

#
#   With non-alphabetic base characters, dead_greek single press is a dead key
#   for CIRCLED, alongside dead_greek double press, that is the general-purpose
#   *dead_circled and supports also multikey equivalents with less, greater and
#   underscore, that otherwise conflict with polytonic Greek letters.
#   See #^# CIRCLED
#
#   The base character for "⊚" U229A is degree, and its ASCII alias parenright
#   is based on French AZERTY keycap mnemonics, where parenright and degree are
#   both on E11.
#
#   The base character for "⊗" U2297 is multiply, and its ASCII alias semicolon
#   is based on French AZERTY keycap mnemonics, where semicolon and period are
#   both on B08, and the dot operator is related to multiplication.
#
#   Zero yields circled number 10, for usability and consistency with Unicode,
#   as circled zero "⓪" U24EA, "⓿" U24FF, "🄋" U1F10B, "🄌" U1F10C is so rare
#   that some items weren’t even encoded in the first place: U24FF was added in
#   Unicode 4.0, U1F10B and U1F10C were added as late as in Unicode 7.0.
#
#   As a consequence, the base character for circled zero is ASCII grave, with
#   positional mnemonic based on US-QWERTY’s E00 grave, and with alphabetically
#   consistent grave on this layout’s key B06, "N" like "null".
#
#   For sideways compatibility with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, multikey sequences
#   with a leading opening parenthesis are also supported.
#   See # # Circled by leading parenthesis
#
#   The efficiency of the level-3 Greek or circled dead key is used to likewise
#   support circled numbers with inverted colors, called negative (referring to
#   photography), and circled sans-serif numbers. Unicode has encoded several
#   font types in various ranges, listed for reference:
#
#   Digits and numbers:
#
#       CIRCLED:                             0 ("⓪" U24EA) .. 50 ("㊿" U32BF)
#       (DINGBAT) NEGATIVE CIRCLED:          0 ("⓿" U24FF) .. 20 ("⓴" U24F4)
#       DINGBAT CIRCLED SANS-SERIF:          0 ("🄋" U1F10B).. 10 ("➉" U2789)
#       DINGBAT NEGATIVE CIRCLED SANS-SERIF: 0 ("🄌" U1F10C).. 10 ("➓" U2793)
#
#   Letters:
#
#       NEGATIVE CIRCLED: A ("🅐" U1F150) .. Z ("🅩" U1F169)
#       SQUARED:          A ("🄰" U1F130) .. Z ("🅉" U1F149)
#       NEGATIVE SQUARED: A ("🅰" U1F170) .. Z ("🆉" U1F189)
#
#   Among these, most are supported by dead key with multikey equivalent, while
#   the 21..50 range of circled numbers is supported by multikey only.

#   the full set of basic circled numbers "⓪" U24EA.."㊿" U32BF is supported by

#   The leading backslash (on D04) is in synergy with the level-3 position of
#   this dead key on D06. Mnemonically, the percent sign would be a better fit,
#   as this is about inverted colors; yet ergonomically it is worse, due to its
#   mapping on key D02, two keys farther from D06.
#
#   This also supports circled and squared letters. As these come in uppercase
#   only, for intuitivity uppercase is used for squared, lowercase for circled
#   consistently with the more rounded shapes of lowercase vs uppercase.
#
#   These SMP dingbats have limited cross-platform compatibility.

#   Unlike squared digit emoji, squared letter dingbats are separately encoded.
#   These sequences are based on convenience and shape-based mnemonic. These
#   SMP dingbats have limited cross-platform compatibility. For streamlining an
#   implementation, equivalents with inverted color are supported based on this
#   feature and by repurposing lowercase so as to skip the overhead of flagging
#   the sequences for squared like here.

#   dead_greek double press
#   Multi_key: ¦@@
#   Dchar: 
#
#   This scheme supports double-circled numbers, available from 1 through 10,
#   since single-circled numbers are supported in dead_greek single press.
#   As a result, dead_greek triple press is not used.
#   See #^# CIRCLED_TEEN
#
#   For an easier alternative, double-circled numbers are in dead_doubleacute,
#   too.
#   See #*# DOUBLE_ACUTE
#
#   Circled operators are also supported for consistency, although these are
#   redundant with dead_greek single press except for "⨷" U2A37, where single
#   press yields "⊗" U2297, and for "⦸" U29B8, because backslash is used as an
#   attribute for circled inverted color numbers.
#   See # # CIRCLED_NEGATIVE
#
#   As a diacritic,  "⃝" U20DD is provided, and "⚪" U26AA as a spacing clone.

#   Followed by quotedbl, EuroSign, apostrophe or rightsinglequotemark,
#   dead_acute yields high curly quotation marks U201D, U2019 (closing or
#   opening).
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#   See # # Comma-shaped quotation marks
#
#   Composed "J" with acute "J́" is in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, but composed "Ĳ"
#   with acute "Ĳ́" is not, nor do all fonts render it correctly with an accent
#   on each letter partial making up the all-in-one digraph letter.

#
#   Followed by Éé, dead_acute is a shortcut to Ãã for Portuguese, with spatial
#   mnemonic on AZERTY, where "A" (D01) is close to "É" (E02).
#
#   Followed by Àà, dead_acute is a shortcut to Õõ for Portuguese, with spatial
#   mnemonic on AZERTY, where "O" (D09) is close to "À" (E10).
#
#   Followed by Èè, dead_acute is a shortcut to Ññ for Breton and Spanish, with
#   spatial mnemonic on AZERTY, where "N" (B06) is below "È" (E07).
#
#   Followed by Ùù, dead_acute is a shortcut to unicase glottal stop "ʔ" U0294,
#   with alphabetic mnemonic and accounting for the lack of level-2 uppercase,
#   while casing glottal stop is in group 1 of Qq.
#
#   The primes by digits sequences add to the support of "′" U2032, "″" U2033,

#   Symbols for documentation
#
#   Outline square brackets "⟦" U27E6, "⟧" U27E7 used in math are supported in
#   dead_acute by "/" and "\" or "·" U00B7 periodcentered additionally to their
#   support in dead_grave and dead_tilde by "[" and "]", to work around the
#   special formatting triggered by some ASCII-bracketed strings in Markdown,
#   when the actual intent is to mark up keycaps in documentation.

#   Acute accent below
#
#   The acute accent below virtual dead key is removed as designed to foster
#   a better quotation mark input method, the more as there are no precomposed
#   letters with an acute accent below. Therefore, a virtual dead key is not
#   required. The only two “acute below” characters are supported by ampersand
#   for "̗" U0317 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT BELOW, and by underscore for "ˏ" U02CF
#   MODIFIER LETTER LOW ACUTE ACCENT.

#   A hook may also be referred to as a shepherd’s staff or crook, that other
#   languages may name this diacritic after. French calls it "crosse" and thus
#   alleviates the semantically overloaded hook (“crochet”). It may also be
#   referred to as a fishhook, like in the names of "ɾ" U027E and "𝼑" U1DF11.
#
#   This includes tone bars, due to good mnemonic based on "I", mapped like "{"
#   on D08. Tone bars also have dedicated multikey support.
#   See #^# Tone bars

#   Followed by period, dead_hook yields "⁕" U2055 FLOWER PUNCTUATION MARK.

#   As a diacritic, "̡" U0321 COMBINING PALATALIZED HOOK BELOW is included, and
#   as a spacing modifier letter, "˞" U02DE MODIFIER LETTER RHOTIC HOOK, based

#   As a diacritic, the double ring is used, as coming closest to a curl below.
#   Since the combining double ring below has no spacing clone nor any modifier
#   looking close to it, the centered half rings "˒" U02D2, "˓" U02D3 are used
#   instead, with a rationale based on the laterality of the AltFr and AltGr
#   modifier keys involved in typing these left and right half rings this way.

#   As a diacritic, the double ring is used, as coming closest to a flourish.
#   Since the combining double ring below has no spacing clone nor any modifier
#   looking close to it, the centered half rings "˒" U02D2, "˓" U02D3 are used

#   A retroflex hook may be referred to as a tail, a hook tail, a right hook.
#
#   A shortcut for "Ꝕ" UA754, "ꝕ" UA755 P WITH SQUIRREL TAIL is provided for
#   convenience and ease of input, thanks to the availability of the "P", "p"
#   base characters.
#   See #^# CURL
#
#   As a result, *dead_retroflexhook supports "ᶏ" U1D8F, "𝼝" U1DF1D, "Ɖ" U0189,
#   "ɖ" U0256, "ᶒ" U1D92, "ᶖ" U1D96, "ɭ" U026D, "ɳ" U0273, "𝼛" U1DF1B,

#   The full set of 10 recycling symbols is supported with digits as base chars
#   consistently with the paper symbols in dead_abovedot, with graphic mnemonic
#   based on the cycle-shaped letter "O" (D09) this dead key is on, by lack of
#   the alphabetic mnemonic, except when considering the dead key name, since
#   *dead_retroflexhook moved from key "R" (D04) in the wake of making room for
#   the Euro sign. The proximity with dead_abovedot also has a mnemonic upside.

#
#   For L and l, dead_abovedot results in WITH MIDDLE DOT.
#
#   For i and j, dead_abovedot results in DOTLESS, applying binary logic. As a
#   consequence, dotless letters do not need support on live keys or in groups.
#
#   This supports various combining dots, with digits as base characters, and
#   with numeric or numpad-based mnemonics using the position of the key on the
#   numpad or the bump on key "5" (C52):

#   The Chinantec tone marks "ꜗ" UA717, "ꜘ" UA718, "ꜙ" UA719 are intuitively

#
#   The group activated by a single dead key press is group 1, not group 2 nor
#   “secondary group”, as the base layout is numbered group 0, not “primary
#   group” like in ISO/IEC 9995.
#
#   A group dead key double press activates group 2, not group 3, consistently
#   with the number of group dead key presses. Triple press is also supported,
#   and so is quadruple press as the upper limit for a sustainable UX.
#
#   Group 1 of every digit activates the corresponding group from 3 through 12.
#   As a consequence, group 1 of digits is not available for mapping.

# # Letter apostrophe and Polynesian ʻeta, Hawaiʻian ʻokina

#   These word boundary preventing characters are needed in Breton and in

#   See # # D07 apostrophe

# # Oslash for Danish, Norwegian and other languages
#
#   While ISO layouts have Øø in group 1 of Oo, and Œœ in group 1 of Ee, for
#   intuitivity and predictability both letters Ææ and Œœ are in group 1 of Aa
#   and Oo in this layout, leaving no room for Oslash.
#
#   Oslash has normal support in dead_stroke, but as a convenience for Danish
#   and other languages, Oslash is in group 1 of Ccedilla and Odiaeresis.
#   On AZERTY, Ccedilla is above the O key, while Swiss QWERTZ has also an
#   Odiaeresis live key. In an effort to mitigate the inconvenience of not
#   having Øø in group 1 of Oo, Oslash is additionally in dead_diaeresis,
#   with Ccedilla as a base character again, and good mnemonic since Danish Øø
#   is phonetically equivalent to Swedish Öö.

# # HORIZONTAL BAR for African and Breton variants
#
#   On Breton variants, the base and shift positions of key E08 are used for
#   "ñ" U00F1, "Ñ" U00D1; on African variants, for "ɔ" U0254, "Ɔ" U0186. (On
#   Polynesian variants, only unshifted E08 is used for the macron dead key.)
#
#   To work around the loss of the key position where the HORIZONTAL BAR dash
#   is mapped, this is in group 1 of case insensitive OPEN O and N WITH TILDE
#   mapped on that key in African and Breton variants respectively.

# # Fallback input methods for HORIZONTAL BAR
#
#   As U2015 HORIZONTAL BAR is rather rare, its key position may be used for
#   the Unicode HYPHEN U2010, if this does not require an unshifted position
#   such as the one on key B10. In any event, if making room for the Unicode
#   HYPHEN U2010 meets user preferences, most famously when Lucida Sans Unicode
#   is used, then these dead key based ways to input HORIZONTAL BAR ease the
#   removal of U2015 on non-regional layouts, too. (The bad support of the
#   Unicode HYPHEN is a well-founded design decision.)
#   See #   Hyphens
#
#   Given that EN DASH and EM DASH are used as base characters for TWO-EM DASH
#   U2E3A and THREE-EM DASH U2E3B, the SOFT HYPHEN and NON-BREAKING HYPHEN are
#   left over as base characters for HORIZONTAL BAR.
#   See ### Group dead key introduction
#   See # # C07 underscore
#
#   The HORIZONTAL BAR Unicode informative alias is “quotation dash”. No doubt
#   the Cambria font makes the most sense of it, giving it a three-quarter em
#   length and making it a four-per-three-em dash. Other fonts use this dash
#   to feature a conjoining EM DASH, while EM DASH is often not conjoining
#   (which is the reason why the TWO- and THREE-EM DASHes have been encoded).
#   See # # Long dashes

#   Encoded in 2012 for Unicode 6.1, the THREE-EM DASH may stand for the author
#   name in bibliographies, and the TWO-EM DASH fills gaps from missing letters
#   or words, that the THREE-EM DASH may also be used to represent.
#
#   These are documented by Jukka Korpela, who links also to the archive of the
#   Unicode Public Mailing List.

#   The TWO-EM DASH and THREE-EM DASH are both in group 1, depending on whether

# # Micro and pound signs for backward compatibility
#
#   "£" U00A3 POUND SIGN and "µ" U00B5 MICRO SIGN are both supported on level-5
#   and level-7 live key positions (key L or M for mnemonics, key D12 or C12
#   for hardware compatibility, key D04 or D06 for level-5 positions).
#   Additionally, this group-1 scheme improves backward compatibility.
#
#   In any event and for convenience, the micro sign is thus in group 1 of the
#   greater-than* double angle quotation mark, that has a live key position on
#   the same key C12 as the group dead key on unremapped layouts of this family
#   and as the micro sign on French AZERTY. "»" U00BB is at level 5 of regular
#   layouts, while "<NBTSP>»" UEF65 is at level 2. So is the pound sign in
#   group 1 of the greater-than* single angle quotation mark on D12.
#
#   For consistency, the nearby percent sign, on key C11 of French AZERTY, is
#   given a similar facility, and the multicharacter strings of spaced-out
#   guillemets with an NBTSP inside (after/before) are supported, too. So is
#   the pound sign on key D12 based on the greater-than* single angle quotation
#   mark "›" U203A, while the nearby diaeresis gets its spacing clone only, for
#   feasability on XCompose not supporting chained dead keys. The asciicircum,
#   dollar sign and generic currency sign as printed on keycaps are supported
#   altogether, and even the equals sign on E12 and the ampersand on E01. But
#   it stops here, and this fully works on unremapped layouts only, assuming
#   that remapping defeats the point in backward compatibility anyway.
#
#   * "«" U00AB and "»" U00BB are referred to as "less-than/greater-than double
#     angle quotation marks", since they are always similar in shape to two
#     "<" U003C LESS-THAN SIGNs or ">" U003E GREATER-THAN SIGNs, while their
#     other attributes (left, right, opening, closing) depend on the context
#     they are used in: a left-to-right script or a right-to-left script as of
#     the pointing direction, and the language as of the opening or closing
#     semantics. The same holds true with single symbols for the single angle
#     quotation marks "‹" U2039 and "›" U203A.

# # Tabular minus sign
#
#   The FIGURE DASH is a tabular minus sign used in typesetting tables, not in
#   interval notation, although it was recommended for that purpose.
#   https://web.archive.org/web/20210224183416/http://www.technicalauthoring.com/wiki/index.php/Figure_dash
#
#   Since FIGURE DASH occurs in single instances only, it is compatible with
#   dead key input, unlike FIGURE SPACE and PUNCTUATION SPACE that are the
#   tabular digit and punctuation spaces, respectively, and are mapped on live
#   keys B07 (digitspace) and B08 (punctspace), level 7, in ASCII mode.
#
#   FIGURE DASH is not supported on live key to prevent its misuse for interval
#   notation, a use case that "–" U2013 EM DASH is recommended for, as vertical
#   alignment issues are to be handled at font level.

# # Arrows as on the numpad
#
#   These are needed to palliate a lack of the dedicated or integrated numpad.
#
#   Five sets of arrows and ten arrow emoji have an input method using digits
#   0..9 in groups 2..7. The digits are based on the position of cursor arrows
#   on the numpad on keys 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8. The remaining single headed arrows
#   are extrapolated; double-headed left-right is placed on 5, up-down on 0.
#
#   The arrow emoji are heterogeneous in that the cardinal arrows are plain
#   arrows ("⬅" U2B05 LEFTWARDS BLACK ARROW and 3 others), whereas the diagonal
#   and bidirectional arrows are picked from the basic arrows. For a consistent
#   user experience, this mix makes up an extra set.
#   See # # Arrow emoji
#
#   Group 1 is not used here, since digits in group 1 are dead keys activating
#   other groups. And groups 8 and 10 are used for mathematical digit symbols:
#   double-struck (U1D7D8..) and sans-serif (U1D7E2..).
#
#   So, groups 9, 11 and 12 are used for additional arrow sets: triangle-headed
#   to bar (U2B70..) as of BMP arrows, and the wide-headed light (U1F860..) and
#   very heavy (U1F880..) in the SMP. The sans-serif set U1F850.. is skipped as
#   not providing enough added value with respect to the fact that on Windows,
#   the DEADTRANS macro only supports one single code unit output instead of 2,
#   5 or more, and as a consequence, SMP characters are hard to input by dead
#   keys.
#
#   0 and 5 are used to input the high surrogate, thanks to the fact that these
#   arrows do not include bidirectional, double-headed arrows pointing in
#   opposite directions.
#
#   The numpad live key level depends on the Mode Lock toggle state.

#   Dchar: "¤" U00A4
#
#   This is 100% sideways compatible with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, except for the
#   double press, used to activate the CURRENCY_EXTENDED dead key, rather than
#   to yield the generic currency sign "¤" U00A4.
#
#   The generic currency sign "¤" U00A4 however is extensively supported, with
#   both the two breaking and the two no-break spaces as base characters, both
#   after single and double press, and by case insensitive <Multi_key><x><o>
#   sequences as sideways compatible multikey equivalents.
#   See #^# CURRENCY_EXTENDED
#   See # # Currency symbols by ISO codes
#
#   Letters Jj Qq Vv Xx Zz are unused in en_US.UTF-8/Compose dead_currency,
#   while nine symbols are left over among support by Latin base letters.
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, the BENGALI RUPEE MARK "৲" U09F2 requires a thorn
#   live key, as "T", "t" base letters are used up for "₮" U20AE, "৳" U09F3,
#   while the INDIAN RUPEE SIGN "₹" U20b9 is supported only by multikey « ¦=R »
#   sequences. The other seven symbols are unsupported in en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#   New base:
#   J        "৲" U09F2 # BENGALI RUPEE MARK
#   j        "₹" U20B9 # INDIAN RUPEE SIGN
#   Q        "₹" U20B9 # INDIAN RUPEE SIGN alternative
#   q        "֏" U058F # ARMENIAN DRAM SIGN
#   V        "₺" U20BA # TURKISH LIRA SIGN
#   v        "₾" U20BE # LARI SIGN
#   X        "₸" U20B8 # TENGE SIGN
#   x        "₼" U20BC # MANAT SIGN
#   Z        "₽" U20BD # RUBLE SIGN
#   z        "₷" U20B7 # SPESMILO SIGN
#
#   These are also supported in the new double press CURRENCY_EXTENDED,
#   as well as the following:
#
#   "₿" U20BF # BITCOIN SIGN
#   "₶" U20B6 # LIVRE TOURNOIS SIGN
#   "₻" U20BB # NORDIC MARK SIGN
#
#   See #^# CURRENCY_EXTENDED
#
#   These are duplicated on another base letter as well:
#
#   "৲" U09F2 # BENGALI RUPEE MARK
#   "₢" U20A2 # CRUZEIRO SIGN
#   "₵" U20B5 # CEDI SIGN
#   "₱" U20B1 # PESO SIGN
#   "௹" U0BF9 # TAMIL RUPEE SIGN
#
#   "₵" U20B5 # CEDI SIGN has Ccedilla as a base character too, for consistency
#   with en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#   Integral symbols are also supported, based on "S" mnemonic, with the
#   corresponding digits as base characters. Likewise, contour integrals
#   are supported too, although these are also in dead_abovering.

#
#   Both breve and inverted breve have their own dead key, for consistency with
#   the ASCII symbol map used for dead key multikey equivalents.
#
#   As inverted breve has only 6×2 precomposed letters, it might be virtualized
#   by dead breve double press. Nevertheless it has a dead key of its own, for
#   consistency with ASCII symbols, and with its XKB keysym dead_invertedbreve.
#
#   Inverted breve has no reported usage outside Unicode precomposed letters.
#   https://www.frathwiki.com/Inverted_Breve
#
#   "˓" U02D3 MODIFIER LETTER CENTRED LEFT HALF RING is mapped to unconflicting
#   and case insensitive C, with its right equivalent in dead_breve.
#
#   This also supports the new U1DF00 LATIN SMALL LETTER FENG DIGRAPH WITH
#   TRILL, because the trill looks like two inverted breves, or a double
#   inverted breve.
#
#   With case insensitive G as a base character, dead_invertedbreve has a
#   shortcut for "⁐" U2050 CLOSE UP.
#   See # # Proofreading mark
#
#   The double diacritic "͡" U0361 has emdash as a mnemonic base character, and
#   dollar as an ASCII alternative with "double" mnemonics, for consistent
#   input methods across all dead keys featuring a double diacritic.

#   The double diacritic "᷼" U1DFC has emdash as a mnemonic base character, and
#   dollar as an ASCII alternative with "double" mnemonics, for consistent
#   input methods across all dead keys featuring a double diacritic.
#
#   Given that breve below and inverted breve below do not have spacing clones,
#   and for a consistent scheme across breve and inverted breve using modifier
#   letters only, not symbols nor punctuation, the top and bottom half o seem a
#   better fit. As these come in a baseline set and a superscript set, both are
#   provided, with the superscript going on the no-break thin space as a base.

#
#   The rationale for merging the BELT dead key with the BREVE dead key is
#   similarity in shape. But in practice, BELT cannot be merged with BREVE,
#   because of the composed L with combining breve used in Inng. As a result,
#   *dead_belt is merged with dead_belowbreve, dead_breve double press.
#
#   As an easier alternative, HORN could be used, but it is not, for the sake
#   of mnemonics, and to prevent HORN from becoming a holdall dead key.
#   See #*# HORN
#
#   BELT cannot be merged with HOOK either, because of "𝼑" U1DF11, nor with
#   CURL, because of "ȴ" U0234, nor with FLOURISH, because of "𝼦" U1DF26.
#
#   BELT cannot be merged with RETROFLEX_HOOK either because of "ɭ" U026D, nor
#   with PALATAL_HOOK because of "ᶅ" U1D85, and because RETROFLEX_HOOK and
#   PALATAL_HOOK occur together with BELT on "ꞎ" UA78E, "𐞝" U1079D, "𝼓" U1DF13.
#
#   BELT cannot be merged with RING either, because this occurs as middle ring
#   on small l: "ꬹ" UAB39.
#
#   The double diacritic "͜" U035C has emdash as a mnemonic base character, and
#   dollar as an ASCII alternative with "double" mnemonics, for consistent
#   input methods across all dead keys featuring a double diacritic.
#
#   For a spacing clone of the combining breve below, "⏑" U23D1 METRICAL BREVE
#   could be picked. Yet it is a symbol, not a letter, so it is not a good fit.
#   Given that breve below and inverted breve below do not have spacing clones,
#   and for a consistent scheme across breve and inverted breve using modifier
#   letters only, not symbols nor punctuation, the TOP and BOTTOM HALF O seem a
#   better fit. As these come in a baseline set and a superscript set, both are
#   provided, with the superscript going on the no-break thin space as a base.

#
#   In X11 XKB, the diacritic called “stroke” had an ambiguous shape, until the
#   horizontal stroke and the oblique stroke were distinguished, by introducing
#   the new dead_longsolidusoverlay keysym named after U0338 "̸" COMBINING LONG
#   SOLIDUS OVERLAY as one of four extra dead elements for the German T3 layout
#   designed around 2010 and standardized in 2012 as DIN 2137:2012.

#
#   The use of dead_stroke for horizontal, rather than for diagonal while
#   introducing *dead_bar to cover horizontal, appears to be fueled by the name
#   of the combining diacritic and the character names containing WITH STROKE
#   with the meaning of WITH BAR, or BARRED, like UAB33 LATIN SMALL LETTER
#   BARRED E, or in the Unicode 1.0 name of U0197 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH
#   STROKE, previously LATIN CAPITAL LETTER BARRED I (Unicode 1.0).
#   See # # Bar and stroke diacritics
#
#   But since dead_longsolidusoverlay was removed in 2023, dead_stroke is used
#   for slash-shaped diacritics again, while missing *dead_bar gets a PUA code.

#   All barred letters occurring in orthographies have their precomposed form
#   encoded in Unicode, since the overlay bar diacritics do not render well.

#   As a spacing counterpart of the short bar diacritic "̵" U0335, "˗" U02D7
#   MODIFIER LETTER MINUS SIGN is convenient, since it is not the superscript
#   minus sign, despite being named a modifier letter.
#   See #*# SUPERSCRIPT
#
#   Consistently with other dead keys supporting diacriticized math symbols,
#   braceright yields "⦵" U29B5, with mnemonics based on braceright as the base
#   character of "∅" U2205 in the symbol group 2.

#   The eponymous letter of this virtual dead key is "Ⱡ" U2C60 LATIN CAPITAL
#   LETTER L WITH DOUBLE BAR, "ⱡ" U2C61 LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH DOUBLE BAR.
#
#   The short bar overlay in "Ꟈ" UA7C7 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH SHORT STROKE
#   OVERLAY is longer than the standard bar in "Đ" U0110 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D
#   WITH STROKE, and so makes a good point for support in this double press bar
#   virtual dead key.
#
#   "–" U2013 EN DASH is supported in this double bar virtual dead key, with
#   period as a base character, for sideways compatibility with the sequence in

#   Budu uses MODIFIER LETTER SHORT EQUALS SIGN "꞊" UA78A as a tone letter, and
#   this is picked here to fill the modifier letter slot, due to its “double”
#   semantics. Additionally, with respect to vertical alignment, UA78A matches
#   its single press counterpart "˗" U02D7 MODIFIER LETTER MINUS SIGN, while
#   "˭" U02ED MODIFIER LETTER UNASPIRATED is in *dead_flag.

#   This dead key is required to have an intuitive input method for "Ꝉ" UA748,
#   "ꝉ" UA749, that adds to "Ƚ" U023D, "ƚ" U019A on #dead_bar single press, and
#   "Ⱡ" U2C60, "ⱡ" U2C61 on *dead_bar double press.
#
#   "—" U2014 EM DASH could be supported in this high bar dead key to get the
#   closest possible to sideways compatibility with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, given
#   this has a multikey sequence for it: <Multi_key><minus><minus><minus>.
#   However, for consistency with the UCS, a sequence with a triple minus and
#   a final period is used for "―" U2015 HORIZONTAL BAR, since this may have a
#   length of three quarters of an em dash, being a four-per-three-em dash; and
#   a new multikey sequence made of a quadruple minus is added to support U2014
#   by multikey, although all of these three dashes are on live keys except for
#   "―" U2015 on part of the regional variants.

#
#   As a diacritic, "᫢" U1AE2 COMBINING MINUS SIGN ABOVE comes in handy with
#   Unicode 17.0. Less consistently, the modifier letters are arrowheads, with
#   a rationale based on the laterality of the AltFr and AltGr modifiers
#   involved in typing "˂" U02C2 and "˃" U02C3. To complete the set, "˄" U02C4
#   and "˅" U02C5 are mapped to mnemonic, case insensitive letters "A" and "V".
#   Additionally, along the lines of what is done on dead_caron double press,
#   "C", "G", "W" can be used to input "˂" U02C2, and "D", "M", "P", "R" are
#   for "˃" U02C3.

#*# HORN
#   horn, notch, descender
#   dead_horn
#   Multi_key: ¦+
#   Dchar: "ơ" U01A1
#
#   As HORN has no reported usage outside Unicode precomposed letters, and the
#   precomposed letters with horn alone come in two pairs only, dead_horn is
#   extended to support the Swedish "ⱸ" U2C78 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH NOTCH,
#   and the historic letters with descender "Ⱨ" U2C67, "ⱨ" U2C68, "Ⱪ" U2C69,
#   "ⱪ" U2C6A, "Ⱬ" U2C6B, "ⱬ" U2C6C, "Ꞑ" UA790, "ꞑ" UA791. The mnemonic is
#   based on considering the descender and the notch as low horns or downwards
#   horns.
#   https://www.frathwiki.com/Horn
#   https://www.frathwiki.com/Descender
#   https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%B1%B8
#
#   HORN could also be used as an easier alternative for the belt diacritic.
#   It is not, to prevent HORN from becoming an unmnemonic holdall.
#   See #^# BREVE_BELOW
#
#   Digits yield simple arrows "←" U2190.."↙" U2199 as a redundant facility
#   expected to meet most common user expectations. Double arrows are yielded
#   by *dead_flag.
#   See #*# FLAG
#
#   This also supports "᫉" U1AC9 COMBINING DOUBLE PLUS SIGN ABOVE and "᫊" U1ACA
#   COMBINING DOUBLE PLUS SIGN BELOW, while single counterparts are supported
#   in combining above for "᫈" U1AC8, combining below for "̟" U031F.
#   See #^# COMBINING_ABOVE
#   See #^# COMBINING_BELOW
#
#   Instead of a non-existing spacing clone of "̛" U031B, "ꜚ" UA71A is picked,
#   based on the horn’s shape, although this is a Chinantec tone mark, but a
#   spacing modifier letter anyway.
#
#   The other Chinantec tone marks "ꜗ" UA717, "ꜘ" UA718, "ꜙ" UA719 are in
#   dead_abovedot, and the full set has dedicated multikey support.
#   See #*# DOT_ABOVE
#   See #^# Chinantec tone marks
#
#   Another mnemonic spacing modifier letter, "˖" U02D6 MODIFIER LETTER PLUS
#   SIGN, based on the horn’s multikey equivalent, is supported by other base
#   letters: case insensitive P as the most mnemonic, but also by all other
#   fully available base letters for a streamlined user experience.
#
#   Consistently with other dead keys supporting diacriticized math symbols,
#   and with mnemonics based on dead_horn’s multikey equivalent, less yields
#   "⥆" U2946, and greater yields "⥅" U2945.

#
#   Unlike superscript letters, used as abbreviation indicators in French and
#   other Latin-script-using languages, subscripts do not seem to be used in
#   orthographies of natural languages.
#
#   By lack of preformatted subscript uppercase, the uppercase slots are used
#   for small caps, frequent in phonetics, consistently with other dead key
#   implementations.
#
#   Letters still missing after a proposal advising to encode them all were
#   replaced with "∄" U2204 THERE DOES NOT EXIST for the time being.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02141-n2419-uralic-phonetic.pdf#page=5
#
#   But ultimately, all these instances are populated with the remaining Greek
#   preformatted letters, both subscript and small caps:
#
#       "ᴦ" U1D26 # GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL GAMMA
#       "ᴧ" U1D27 # GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL LAMDA
#       "ᴨ" U1D28 # GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL PI
#       "ᴩ" U1D29 # GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL RHO
#       "ᴪ" U1D2A # GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL PSI
#       "ꭥ" UAB65 # GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL OMEGA — This did not fit in the
#            subscript empty slots, but it is both on regular V and intuitive O
#            in the SUBSCRIPT&GROUP_6 and GREEK_OR_CIRCLED&SUBSCRIPT virtual
#            dead keys.
#       "ᵦ" U1D66 # GREEK SUBSCRIPT SMALL LETTER BETA
#       "ᵧ" U1D67 # GREEK SUBSCRIPT SMALL LETTER GAMMA
#       "ᵨ" U1D68 # GREEK SUBSCRIPT SMALL LETTER RHO
#       "ᵩ" U1D69 # GREEK SUBSCRIPT SMALL LETTER PHI

#
#   This started supporting "⃨" U20E8 COMBINING TRIPLE UNDERDOT when it was
#   moved in the wake of (temporarily) freeing up groups 1..3 of numbersign,
#   with the rationale that combining below is lower than the baseline ellipsis
#   (that is on live key except in ASCII mode), and that this character has
#   other input methods, too.
#   See #*# DOT_BELOW
#   See # # C01 numbersign
#
#   The associated diacritic "̲" U0332 and its spacing clone, ASCII "_" U005F,
#   are built on the underscore theme hinted by the subscript’s TeX command.
#   See #*# SUPERSCRIPT
#
#   The multikey equivalent of "₋" U208B conflicts with "ᴃ" U1D03, "ᵻ" U1D7B,
#   "ᵾ" U1D7E and "ᶧ" U1DA7, but this can be worked around by typing it the
#   other way around instead. The same holds true for "₎" U208E conflicting
#   with "𐞜" U1079C, "𝼄" U1DF04.

#   the multikey equivalent would conflict with mathematical symbols and is

#   This supports the keycap diacritic  "⃣" U20E3 with dead_ogonek as a base
#   character, and a mnemonic based on the brackets pair. The multikey
#   equivalent without full ASCII does not make sense, while with full ASCII,
#   the multikey equivalent would conflict with mathematical symbols and is
#   thus deactivated, as this facility is not worth screwing up the math.

#
#   Since the combining hook above has no spacing clone nor any modifier letter
#   looking close to it, both half rings "ʾ" U02BE, "ʿ" U02BF are provided as a
#   stopgap, with a rationale based on the laterality of the AltFr and AltGr
#   modifier keys involved in typing these left and right half rings this way.
#   AltGr + space yields nobreakspace, and the no-break thin space U202F is on
#   AltFr + space.

#   As the glottal letters new to Unicode v12 are diacriticized with a spiritus
#   lenis, Greek psili, they are here in a dedicated virtual dead key, based on
#   the hook above as looking closest. However, given the psili is considered a
#   comma above, and has been encoded consistently, these letters are also part
#   of the virtual dead key based on dead_belowcomma double press with a set of
#   duplicates in dead_belowcomma for convenience.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_breathing
#
#   As a diacritic, a mark looking close to a right half ring is picked, for an
#   alternative to the comma above: "҆" U0486, although this is Cyrillic. But a
#   dedicated spacing clone is available for Greek smooth breathing: "᾿" U1FBF.

#   Dchar: "ō" U014D
#
#   Cedi "₵" U20B5 and Cent "¢" U00A2 signs are supported by lack of C with
#   macron, and for consistency with en_US.UTF-8/Compose as of the multikey
#   equivalents.
#
#   The historic letters with topbar "Ƃ" U0182, "ƃ" U0183, "Ƌ" U018B, "ƌ" U018C
#   are supported alongside thanks to an empty intersection, with a rationale
#   based on the straightforward mnemonic.
#
#   Long leg is merged with macron thanks to an empty intersection and with a
#   mnemonic based on the macron multikey equivalent pipe "|". However, small
#   r with long leg "ɼ" U027C has been obsoleted by IPA in 1989.
#
#   Digits yield the full collection of simple and multiple vertical bars — but
#   not the broken one "¦" U00A6 — for convenience, since input methods using
#   groups or multikey may be less mnemonic or more complicated. This is a part
#   of the design of math sequences.
#   See #   Outsourcing to dead keys
#   See #*# STROKE
#   See #*# REVERSED
#
#   The conjoining variants of the combining diacritics are supported with
#   ampersand as a base character both in macron and in macron below.
#   See "︦" UFE26
#   See "︭" UFE2D
#
#   The double diacritic "͞" U035E has emdash as a mnemonic base character, and
#   dollar as an ASCII alternative with "double" mnemonics, for consistent
#   input methods across all dead keys featuring a double diacritic.
#
#   Combining macron halves above – "︤" UFE24, "︥" UFE25 – are supported on all
#   unconflicting and fully available base letters for a streamlined user
#   experience. Halves of combining diacritics are also supported in a virtual
#   dead key called “tilde and ampersand”.
#   See # # TILDE&AMPERSAND
#
#   Consistently with other dead keys supporting diacriticized math symbols,
#   case insensitive "s" yields "⨛" U2A1B; "L" yields "⋶" U22F6; "l" yields
#   "⋷" U22F7; "M" yields "⋽" U22FD; "m" yields "⋾" U22FE; slash yields
#   ⧶" U29F6; apostrophe and rightsinglequotemark (base characters of "∪" U222A
#   in the symbol group 4 on D07) yield "⩂" U2A42; braceleft on D08 yields
#   "⩃" U2A43; braceright (base character of "∅" U2205 in the symbol group 2)
#   yields "⦱" U29B1; grave on B06, level 3 (base character of "∧" U2227 in the
#   symbol group 2) yields "⊼" U22BC; question on B07, level 3 (and 5), yields
#   "⊽" U22BD; case insensitive "T" yields "⫧" U2AE7.

#   The double diacritic "͟" U035F has emdash as a mnemonic base character, and
#   dollar as an ASCII alternative with "double" mnemonics, for consistent
#   input methods across all dead keys featuring a double diacritic.
#
#   Combining macron halves below "︫" UFE2B, "︬" UFE2C are supported on "W"
#   as well as on all other available base letters, consistently with
#   dead_macron single press, for a streamlined user experience. This is
#   redundant with the tilde-and-ampersand virtual dead key, that supports
#   halves of combining diacritics, too.
#   See # # TILDE&AMPERSAND
#
#   Consistently with other dead keys supporting diacriticized math symbols,
#   case insensitive "s" yields "⨜" U2A1C; semicolon and multiply with B08
#   keycap mnemonics (with period as dot for multiply) yield "⨱" U2A31; slash
#   yields "⦤" U29A4; backslash yields "⦥" U29A5; percent yields "⧋" U29CB;
#   bracketleft/right yield "⦋" U298B, "⦌" U298C; grave on B06, level 3 (base
#   character of "∧" U2227 in the symbol group 2) yields "⩟" U2A5F; question
#   on B07, level 3 (and 5), yields "⩣" U2A63, bar yields "⫨" U2AE8.

#   This is required for the letters used with a real line below, rather than a
#   macron below. But there are no precomposed letters with line below. Names
#   built on "WITH LINE BELOW" refer to a macron below instead.
#   https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_1E00.html
#
#   The associated diacritic and its spacing equivalent are the same as for the
#   subscript dead key. Here, underscore acts as the spacing clone of the
#   diacritic; there, underscore is the ASCII equivalent of *dead_subscript,
#   and "̲" U0332 has the status of a combining clone.
#
#   Consistently with other dead keys supporting diacriticized math symbols,
#   grave (base character of "∧" U2227 in the symbol group 2) yields "⩠" U2A60,
#   with an extra line below compared to "⩟" U2A5F in dead_belowmacron, and
#   question yields "⩣" U2A63.

#
#   Some letters occur both with a diagonal stroke and with an oblique stroke,
#   where the diagonal stroke has the steep slant of a regular slash, while the
#   oblique stroke is only slightly slanted, to such an extent that it might be
#   referred to as an oblique bar, if keeping things straightforward wasn’t the
#   best option. Yet prior to Unicode 16.0, the only letter occurring both with
#   a diagonal stroke and an oblique stroke was "K", where a diagonal stroke is
#   also short: "Ꝃ" UA742 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER K WITH DIAGONAL STROKE. But as
#   Unicode 16.0 adds "Ꟍ" UA7CC LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S WITH DIAGONAL STROKE
#   https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Latin_letter_S_with_diagonal_stroke.svg
#   alongside Unicode 6.0 "Ꞩ" UA7A8 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S WITH OBLIQUE STROKE,
#   the scheme is now clear, and double press is dedicated to oblique stroke.
#   However, empty slots in single press are populated conveniently for a
#   streamlined user experience.
#   See #^# OBLIQUE_STROKE
#
#   In X11 XKB, the diacritic called “stroke” had an ambiguous shape, until the
#   horizontal stroke and the slanted strokes were distinguished by introducing
#   the new dead_longsolidusoverlay keysym named after U0338 "̸" COMBINING LONG
#   SOLIDUS OVERLAY as one of four extra dead elements for the German T3 layout
#   designed around 2010 and standardized in 2012 as DIN 2137:2012.

#   See #*# BAR
#
#   The use of dead_stroke for horizontal, rather than for diagonal while
#   introducing *dead_bar to cover horizontal, appears to be fueled by the name
#   of the combining diacritic and the character names containing "WITH STROKE"
#   with the meaning of WITH BAR, or BARRED, like UAB33 LATIN SMALL LETTER
#   BARRED E, or in the Unicode 1.0 name of U0197 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH
#   STROKE, previously LATIN CAPITAL LETTER BARRED I.
#   See # # Bar and stroke diacritics
#
#   But since dead_longsolidusoverlay was removed in 2023, dead_stroke is used
#   for slash-shaped diacritics again.

#   See # # Bar and stroke diacritics
#
#   For convenience, to account for this confusion, letters without a variant
#   with stroke have their barred variant duplicated in this dead key as well,
#   to make it more lenient, for a streamlined user experience.
#
#   As a spacing counterpart of the long solidus diacritic "̸" U0338, the
#   division slash "∕" U2215 is picked.
#
#   Digits yield mathematical slashes. This is a part of the design of math
#   sequences.
#   See #   Outsourcing to dead keys
#   See #*# REVERSED
#   See #*# MACRON
#
#   Consistently with other dead keys supporting diacriticized math symbols,
#   and to meet strong user expectations and cater for widely used symbols,
#   equal yields "≠" U2260 in group 0, "≢" U2262 in group 1, as "≡" U2261 is in
#   group 1 of equal; less yields "≮" U226E in group 0, "≰" U2270 in groups 1
#   and 2, as "⩽" U2A7D is in group 2 of less; so does greater for "≯" U226F
#   and "≱" U2271.

#
#   As a spacing modifier letter, "⟋" U27CB is picked for graphic consistency,

#   Lowercase "x" is required for "ꭖ" UAB56 LATIN SMALL LETTER X WITH LOW RIGHT
#   RING as a base character, and uppercase "X" is required for "ꭘ" UAB58 LATIN
#   SMALL LETTER X WITH LONG LEFT LEG AND LOW RIGHT RING. For "ꭔ" UAB54 LATIN
#   SMALL LETTER CHI WITH LOW RIGHT RING, "q" is picked as the most expected
#   base character, because in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, it was previously used as a
#   base character for Greek chi when French-style phonetic mnemonics prevailed
#   over graphic mnemonics.
#   See #*# GREEK_OR_CIRCLED
#   See #+# GROUP_3
#   See #+# GROUP_4
#
#   This also supports combining half rings "͑" U0351, "͗" U0357 with matching
#   parentheses as base characters.
#
#   So as to extensively support half rings, spacing half rings are also
#   included. As these are either right, left, raised or centered, digits are
#   used as base characters, with numpad-based mnemonics:
#
#       4  "˓" U02D3 MODIFIER LETTER CENTRED LEFT HALF RING
#       6  "˒" U02D2 MODIFIER LETTER CENTRED RIGHT HALF RING
#       7  "ʿ" U02BF MODIFIER LETTER LEFT HALF RING
#       9  "ʾ" U02BE MODIFIER LETTER RIGHT HALF RING
#
#   Asterisk symbols "⁎" U204E, "⁑" U2051, "⁂" U2042 are also supported, with
#   the related digits as base characters, and so are the asterisk operator
#   "∗" U2217, by "5" with mnemonics based on the centered alignment of this
#   operator, and the star operator "⋆" U22C6 by "8". (But there is no room
#   left for stars "★" U2605 and "☆" U2606, that have easy support in group 1.)
#
#   As a matter of supporting the degree sign by dead key after the loss of its
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose sequence, and regardless of its support on live key,
#   the left-over base character "0" is convenient for "°" U00B0.
#   See # # Degree sign
#
#   Unpreferred yet not discouraged precomposed temperature units "℃" U2103 and
#   "℉" U2109 (but not conflicting "Å" U212B) are supported for completeness,
#   and so is the formally unrelated "K" U212A alongside, although these are
#   supported by dedicated multikey sequences.
#   See #^# Abbreviations, Units and Legal Symbols
#
#   Consistently with other dead keys supporting diacriticized math symbols,
#   case insensitive "T" yields "⟟" U27DF; braceright (base character of
#   "∅" U2205 in the symbol group 2) yields "⦲" U29B2; plus yields "⨢" U2A22;
#   bar yields "⫯" U2AEF.

#
#   The polygrams "êk", "êl", "êm", "ên", "êp", "êqu", "êr", "êt", "êv", "êch"
#   make dead_circumflex behave like an Ê key in most cases by using the fact
#   that the letters k, l, m, n, p, q, r, t, v, x do not exist as precomposed
#   letters with circumflex accent, and most of these are not in usage either
#   with combining circumflex as known composed letters. Those that are, will
#   need to be overridden, so as to prioritize the "Ê" key emulation
#   sequences.

#   Cross-platform compatibility is full on MacOS, but only partial on Windows,
#   that is able to support only lowercase, and only digrams, provided that the
#   dead key is assigned the appropriate dead character: "ê" U00EA LATIN SMALL
#   LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX, for instance.
#
#   Likewise, a "Ç" key is emulated for use on the Canadian French variant.

#
#   Superscript digits
#
#   For the sake of usability and meeting predictable user expectations (that
#   also have been escalated to the level of standards support), superscript
#   digits are supported, at the expense of multikey equivalents.
#   See NF Z71-300:2019, section 6.3.3 page 24
#   See E DIN 2137-1:2020-11
#   See # # Multikey equivalents
#
#   The German E DIN 2137-1:2020-11 has been synced with NF Z71-300:2019, but
#   only with the digits part, not the plus and minus signs nor parentheses.
#   https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_2137#%C3%9Cberarbeitung_2020
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, that the “superscript digits by dead_circumflex”
#   feature comes from, the superscript dead key is missing, consistently with
#   keysymdef.h lacking a *dead_superscript or equivalent keysym.
#   See # # Notes on Unicode support
#   See # # Introducing new-school input composition
#
#   Anyway, the multikey equivalents of this way to input superscript digits
#   cannot be supported, since they conflict with "❤" U2764 as of "³" U00B3, or
#   with the less frequent "♥" U2665, as of "⁸" U2078 if using the new sequence
#   <Multi_key><less><8> introduced for "♥" U2665.
#   See # # Heart emoji
#
#   For full support including multikey equivalents, the diaeresis dead key may
#   likely be an acceptable workaround solution for superscript digits, as some
#   mnemonic, using the traditional French AZERTY mapping of dead_diaeresis on
#   the same key (D11) as dead_circumflex, in shift position, might not be too
#   far-fetched. Superscript digits are also in the superscript dead key.

#
#   Shortcuts
#
#   Followed by Çç, circumflex is a shortcut to Ññ for Breton and Spanish.
#
#   U017F LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S, in group 3 of s, has an additional input
#   method by <dead_circumflex><f>, since French has no words including an "êf"
#   digram.
#
#   "⁂" U2042 ASTERISM is also expected to be supported by dead_circumflex,
#   additionally to its support in the symbol groups and by dead_abovering.
#   See # # C10 bar
#   See #*# RING_ABOVE
#
#   Followed by comma, dead_circumflex provides an additional input method for
#   "ʻ" U02BB MODIFIER LETTER TURNED COMMA.
#   See # # B06 grave
#
#   As "B" has not been encoded with circumflex, and French doesn’t have any
#   word with "êb", <dead_circumflex><B> and <dead_circumflex><b> may be used
#   as shortcuts for anything. "B" mnemonics suggest U WITH BREVE "Ŭ" U016C,
#   "ŭ" U016D (used in Esperanto). Likewise, "U" mnemonics foster the use of
#   Ugrave for the same output (by lack of something else for the time being),
#   since U has not been encoded with circumflex and grave, as opposed to A (by
#   Agrave on key E10), E (by Egrave on key E07) and O (French AZERTY does not
#   feature Ograve).
#
#   The shouldered open box "⍽" U237D, by the at sign, is a convenience for
#   documentation.
#   See # # Symbols for NO-BREAK SPACE
#
#
#   Diacritics
#
#   The doubled diacritic "᪰" U1AB0 COMBINING DOUBLED CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT has
#   case insensitive "d" as base characters, with alphabetic mnemonics,
#   thanks to French not having any word with "êd".
#   https://www.motsavec.com
#   See #   "Ê" key emulation
#   See "᫏" U1ACF
#
#   The double diacritic "᷍" U1DCD has emdash as a mnemonic base character, and
#   dollar as an ASCII alternative with "double" mnemonics, for consistent
#   input methods across all dead keys featuring a double diacritic.
#
#
#   Math symbols
#
#   Consistently with other dead keys supporting diacriticized math symbols,
#   plus yields "⨣" U2A23, and asciitilde yields "⩯" U2A6F.

#   Dchar: "č" U010D
#
#   For ease of access, and in an attempt to meet potential user expectations,
#   the hacek dead key is also activatable by dead_circumflex double press,
#   extending the logic that multiple dead key presses shift diacritics around,
#   to include the idea that a double press may also turn the diacritic, if
#   that is a better option with respect to usability.
#
#   The double dead_circumflex sequences are not added right in the HACEK dead
#   key for maintainability, because this file is also used as the source code
#   for dead key tables.
#   See # # Notes about documentation

#   Consistency with the bépo keyboard layout and other diacritical dead keys
#   requires virtualizing the circumflex accent below dead key by double press
#   of the circumflex accent dead key. Usability however imposes to use this as
#   a shortcut for the hatchek dead key located on B04, level 4, and to move to
#   triple press the variant below, while providing a shortcut using dead_horn
#   double press in an attempt to restore some ease of input.

#   Although the circumflex accent below is extremely rare, Unicode has 6 pairs
#   of Latin letters precomposed with it. Except on Windows, several composed
#   letters are also supported, as C̭, c̭, K̭, k̭, R̭, r̭ are found in the
#   “Palette Accent circonflexe souscrit” on Wikipédia, although with redlinks

#
#   This dead key needs to be in sync with its shortcut by dead_circumflex
#   double press.
#   See #^# HACEK input facility by CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   For ease of access, and in an attempt to meet potential user expectations,
#   the hacek dead key is also activatable by dead_circumflex double press,
#   extending the logic that multiple dead key presses shift diacritics around,
#   to consider that they may also turn them. For portability, the full dead
#   key content is supported, as well as multikey, even though this does not
#   make sense.
#
#   While the most streamlined implementation would be by adding the double
#   dead_circumflex sequences here, for consistency the content is copied and
#   maintained separately, since this file is also a documentation source.
#   See #^# HACEK input facility by CIRCUMFLEX
#   See # # Notes about documentation
#
#
#   Subscript
#
#   The hacek dead key supports subscript digits, for the sake of conformance
#   with NF Z71-300:2019, 6.3.3 p24, that E DIN 2137-1:2020-11 has been synced
#   with.
#   https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_2137#%C3%9Cberarbeitung_2020
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   However, this redundancy with the subscript dead key is not extended to the
#   signs and parentheses, as the standard does not require these, and because
#   their multikey equivalents would need to be deactivated anyway due to
#   conflicts with many mathematical symbols, that would require leading space.
#
#   Another facility, <dead_grave><dead_acute>, would conflict with "‛" U201B
#   in the quotation mark input method. The reverse would be counter-intuitive
#   as well as pointless in the presence of the double circumflex alternative,
#   using the most easily hit dead key of AZERTY.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#
#   Diacritic
#
#   The doubled diacritic "᫏" U1ACF COMBINING DOUBLE CARON (since Unicode 17.0)
#   is the hacek counterpart of "᪰" U1AB0 COMBINING DOUBLED CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT.
#   It has case insensitive "w" as base characters, with graphic mnemonics,
#   thanks to hacek not having any precomposed "w̌".

#   As of alphabetic dead key content, by lack of precomposed letters with a

#   insensitive base letters, rather than to the conflicting less and greater:

#   Symbols other than "⹀" U2E40 DOUBLE HYPHEN cannot be supported in group 0,
#   due to numerous multikey conflicts. (With respect to this, mathematical
#   symbols use <Multi_key><minus><equal>.)

#
#   Cross-platform compatibility
#
#   Windows supports an extra modifier added on Caps Lock for continuous input,
#   and also for composing flags. As for letter emoji, WORD JOINER needs to be
#   appended, on Windows, Shift would need to be held down for writing words,
#   consistently with the uppercase display of letter emoji, but not for flags.
#
#   MacOS supports an iterative dead key for continuous input, on triple press.
#   As XKB has no support for iterative dead keys, the behavior of single press
#   and triple press is swapped, so that single press outputs an appended WJ,
#   and triple press outputs regional indicator symbol letters in isolation.
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, sequences starting with « ¦= » conflict with
#   currency symbols and with double acute, given that en_US.UTF-8/Compose uses
#   « ¦" », not « ¦: », for diaeresis, and so cannot use « ¦" » for
#   dead_doubleacute, and uses « ¦= » instead. Removing currency symbol
#   sequences starting with EQUALS SIGN, and leaving only those ending with
#   EQUALS SIGN, solves this issue.
#   See #^# Currency symbols
#
#
#   Auxiliary characters
#
#   Auxiliary characters are supported with dead keys in synergy as base
#   characters. The multikey equivalents without full ASCII would not make
#   sense, while with full ASCII, most multikey equivalents would conflict with
#   mathematical symbols and are thus deactivated, as this facility is not
#   worth screwing up the math.

#
#   The straightforward diacritic "᫨" U1AE8 COMBINING EQUALS SIGN ABOVE is
#   available since Unicode 17.0. As a spacing counterpart, there is
#   "˭" U02ED MODIFIER LETTER UNASPIRATED, while "꞊" UA78A MODIFIER LETTER
#   SHORT EQUALS SIGN is consistently in *dead_bar double press.

#   The only standardized subdivision flags are England, Scotland and Wales.
#   https://blog.unicode.org/2022/03/the-past-and-future-of-flag-emoji.html
#
#   The 3 subdivision flags supported by Unicode (after projecting to support
#   all subdivision flags, and devising a scheme to do so by composing the
#   subdivision identifiers in lowercase tag characters with an initializer
#   ["🏴" U1F3F4] and a terminator [UE007F CANCEL TAG]) have base characters
#   consistent with the level-10 map for Windows using the AltLe modifier
#   ("Le" for "Letter emoji") added on top of the Caps Lock key (using it
#   requires resetting the toggle status in the wake), at the Shift + AltLe
#   level.
#   https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-list.html#subdivision-flag
#
#       C12: Wales    "gbwls"
#       D12: England  "gbeng"
#       E12: Scotland "gbsct"
#
#   Mnemonics is geospatial, using the stacked layout of these keys. This in
#   turn is constrained by the requirement of duplicate mappings to work around
#   the column-02 bug on Windows, affecting level 10, decimal 65, hex 0x41,
#   the Shift + AltLe level.
#
#       B02 is duplicated on B07
#       C02 is duplicated on C11
#       D02 is duplicated on D11
#       E02 is duplicated on E11
#
#   Partial keycap mnemonics uses "£" printed in shift position on D12 of
#   French AZERTY, on C12 of Belgian AZERTY.
#
#   For convenience, on Linux, a geographically more accurate layout featuring
#   Wales on key D11 is also provided; and with respect to remapped variants,
#   Scotland is replicated on key E11 by at sign, while England has also minus
#   as a base character.
#   See #   Subdivision flags
#
#   For intuitivity, an alphabetic alternative is also provided, although "GB"
#   is used for the country flag, and country flag input is case insensitive.
#   As a workaround, the unused "UK" is prefixed instead, and sequences based
#   on "gbeng", "gbsct", "gbwls" are streamlined to "UKE", "UKS", "UKW".
#
#   On double press, the most straightforward diacritic is "͇" U0347 COMBINING
#   EQUALS SIGN BELOW.
#
#   The sequences with no-break space and no-break thin space, used for spacing
#   clones of diacritics or for modifier letters on most dead keys, output a
#   black flag by no-break space, and a white flag by no-break thin space,
#   since the flag used as a base character for subdivision flags, "🏴" U1F3F4
#   WAVING BLACK FLAG, is in the SMP, cross-platform incompatible.
#
#   However, "🏴" U1F3F4 WAVING BLACK FLAG is supported by backslash, with
#   phonetic mnemonics, as well as by periodcentered (at the base level instead
#   of backslash on most variants), and "🏳" U1F3F3 WAVING WHITE FLAG, by slash.

#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   The reversed primes by digits sequences add to the support of "‵" U2035,
#   "‶" U2036, "‷" U2037 by multikey.
#   See # # Reversed primes
#
#   Outline square brackets "⟦" U27E6, "⟧" U27E7 used in math are supported in
#   dead_grave by "[" and "]" to work around the special formatting triggered
#   by some ASCII-bracketed strings in Markdown, when the actual intent is to
#   mark up keycaps in documentation.

#   "̖" U0316 COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT BELOW has ampersand as a base character,
#   and underscore yields its spacing counterpart "ˎ" U02CE MODIFIER LETTER LOW
#   GRAVE ACCENT, because double press is the double grave accent. Else, double
#   press followed by space or no-break space is the most straightforward input
#   method for the variants below. But there are no precomposed letters with a
#   grave accent below. Therefore, a dedicated virtual dead key is not required
#   for this diacritic.

#
#   Followed by quotedbl, EuroSign, apostrophe or rightsinglequotemark,
#   dead_diaeresis yields low, opening, curly quotation marks U201A, U201E.
#   By multikey, these have also dedicated support.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#   See # # Comma-shaped quotation marks
#
#   Superscript digits are also supported as a full-support alternative to the
#   partial support in dead_circumflex, lacking the multikey equivalents.
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   With diacriticized base letters, dead_diaeresis yields "Ǜ" U01DB, "ǜ" U01DC
#   but also "Ø" U00D8, "ø" U00F8 for convenience.
#   See # # Oslash for Danish, Norwegian and other languages
#
#   For intuitivity, with asterisk as a base character, dead_diaeresis yields
#   "⁑" U2051, consistently with dead_circumflex and *dead_superscript for
#   "⁂" U2042 ASTERISM. "⁑" U2051, "⁂" U2042 and "⁎" U204E are also in
#   dead_abovering.

#   Two less expected yet heavily used symbols, "‖" U2016 DOUBLE VERTICAL LINE
#   and "¦" U00A6 BROKEN BAR repurposed as multikey symbol, have quick access
#   by dead_diaeresis followed by slash, or periodcentered (for AZERTY) and
#   backslash (for remapped variants) respectively, for ease of input, as both
#   the dead key and the base characters are at the base level. (By contrast,
#   the more mnemonic but less practical bar is not used in this context, due
#   to conflicts with the diaeresis and macron virtual dead keys.)

#   The glottal letters new to Unicode v12 are duplicated here for convenience.
#
#   Digits yield numbers 11 through 20 followed by a period, as an experimental
#   convenience, while parenthesized digits and letters are not supported.
#   Numbers 1..10 followed by a period are in dead_cedilla.
#   See #*# CEDILLA
#
#   For convenience, the multikey sequence « ¦§ » is also supported, to account
#   for the mapping of the section sign at level 3 of B10 in French mode for
#   the synergy with digits and for backward compatibility.

#   This yields mainly the glottal letters new to Unicode v12, since these may
#   be expected here, because the spiritus lenis that these glottal letters are
#   diacriticized with, often happens to be shaped like a comma above, that may
#   also be referred to as a curly apostrophe on top, so that "̓" U0313
#   COMBINING COMMA ABOVE is the actual encoding of the combining psili.
#
#   Nevertheless, the glottal letters are also in a dedicated dead key,
