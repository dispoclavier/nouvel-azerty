### Dead keys
#
#   While Windows and macOS can emulate input composition by chained dead keys,
#   XKB is to emulate dead keys by input composition.
#
#   This resulting configuration file is very human readable, and it is easily
#   converted into documentation.
#   See # # Notes about documentation
#
#   Input composition implemented by chaining dead keys is more powerful in
#   that it supports modularity, as opposed to XCompose that requires listing
#   all supported sequences, verbatim and in extenso. The reason why is that
#   this does not work:
#
#       <dead_circumflex> <dead_circumflex> : dead_belowcircumflex
#
#   then:
#
#       <dead_belowcircumflex> <e>          : "ḙ" U1E19 # LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX BELOW
#
#   Although X.org specifies:
#
#       If the string is omitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according
#       to the current locale.
#
#       I.e., if a rule looks like:
#
#           <dead_grave>     <A> : "\300" Agrave
#
#       the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.
#       But if the rule is:
#
#           <dead_grave> <A> : Agrave
#
#       the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.

#
#
# # Notes on Unicode support
#
#   The extended Latin F & G blocks in the SMP are supported since 2023-05-25.
#   The issues related to SMP support do not affect ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, as
#   opposed to Windows, whose Text Services Framework (TSF) is no longer able
#   to keep the Latin script easy to input. Transpiling the related sequences
#   to C will require a move to low surrogates from U10780 to U1DF2A (U1DFFF)
#   along with a facility to input the D801 and D837 high surrogates.
#   https://unicode.org/versions/enumeratedversions.html
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-F
#
#   Due to more comprehensive support for Unicode characters used in Latin
#   script as encoded since version 1.1 of the Standard, some sequences in
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose need to be redefined, by making more extensive use
#   of ASCII symbols and punctuation.
#
#   With Multi_key thought of as a generic dead key taking arguments,
#   the base letter that those modifications are applied to is typed last.
#   This pattern performs much better, as it empowers XCompose to apply
#   multiple diacritics as used e.g. in Vietnamese and Lithuanian.
#
#   As a result, semantics of paired punctuation may be switched compared to
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose. Examples of multikey equivalents for dead_breve:
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose: <Multi_key><a><parenleft>
#   In new-school Compose:  <Multi_key><parenright><a>
#   This scheme is not proper to new school, since in en_US.UTF-8/Compose we
#   already have U-shape:   <Multi_key><U><a>
#   As well as the initial: <Multi_key><b><a>
#
#   While that change alone would not warrant a comprehensive overhaul, more
#   tweaks are required, such as supporting superscript and subscript, using
#   asciicircum and underscore repurposed, formerly circumflex and macron.
#
#   So, when "<" and ">" are used for circumflex and hacek (aka hatchek, caron)
#   and "|" for macron, ":" gets used for diaeresis like in Vim, and <quotedbl>
#   looks fine for double acute accent. A change that is the more desirable as
#   it also fixes an issue with sequences for curly quotation marks.
#
#   Bottom line: Full Unicode support requires an upgraded multikey scheme aka
#   new-school input composition.
#
#
# # Introducing new-school input composition
#
#   "^" and "_" need to be freed up for super- and subscript/smallcap, applying
#   the parentheses-breve scheme to circumflex and hacek, macron and diaeresis.
#   For example, new-school multikey sequences include « ¦^ » for superscript,
#   « ¦> » for hacek, « ¦< » for circumflex accent, « ¦| » for macron, « ¦: »
#   for diaeresis, « ¦" » for the double acute accent, an acute diaeresis.
#   That helps avoid conflicts with the dead key based input method for
#   apostrophe/comma-shaped double quotation marks.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   Another reason to adopt new-school is that in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, <comma>
#   is used for both dead_cedilla and dead_ogonek, resulting in a conflict on E
#   that en_US.UTF-8/Compose works around by using <cedilla> instead of <comma>
#   in the multikey sequences yielding U0228 and U0229. If <semicolon> were
#   used as the multikey equivalent of both dead_belowcomma and dead_ogonek,
#   the result would be yet another dead key merger, rightfully avoided in
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#   Yet another reason is that en_US.UTF-8/Compose, using dead_hook both for
#   hook and hook above, is unable to support "Ƴ" U01B3 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y
#   WITH HOOK and "ƴ" U01B4 LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH HOOK, proving the
#   existing scheme as impracticable.
#
#
# # Virtual dead keys
#
#   The French BÉPO ergonomic keyboard layout defines a number of dead keys as
#   virtualized by dead key double press. The diacritic is either doubled or
#   transformed, i.e. it is shifted to the less frequently diacriticized side
#   of the letter. More information is available in French on the bépo website:
#   https://bepo.fr/wiki/Version_1.1rc1/Touches_mortes/Pressions_multiples
#
#   Based on this, triple or quadruple press virtual dead keys may also be
#   supported as required. Additionally, mixing multiple diacritics on the
#   same letter also requires virtual dead keys. Each one of these dead keys
#   needs a dedicated dead character.
#
#
# # X11 dead key syms defined in keysymdef.h
#
#   Dead keys are defined for Latin and Greek keyboards and for other input
#   methods. Some new dead keys already have a keysym defined in keysymdef.h;
#   an update package can be installed with this command:
#
#       sudo apt-get install x11proto-core-dev
#
#   For Latin keyboard layouts. The 21 keysyms used in this layout are checked:
#
#      dead_abovecomma
#    ✔ dead_abovedot
#      dead_abovereversedcomma
#    ✔ dead_abovering
#      dead_aboveverticalline
#    ✔ dead_acute
#      dead_belowbreve
#      dead_belowcircumflex
#    ✔ dead_belowcomma
#      dead_belowdiaeresis
#    ✔ dead_belowdot
#      dead_belowmacron
#      dead_belowring
#      dead_belowtilde
#      dead_belowverticalline
#    ✔ dead_breve
#    ✔ dead_caron
#    ✔ dead_cedilla
#    ✔ dead_circumflex

#    ✔ dead_horn
#    ✔ dead_invertedbreve
#      dead_lowline
#    ✔ dead_macron
#    ✔ dead_ogonek
#    ✔ dead_stroke
#    ✔ dead_tilde
#
#
# # Bar and stroke diacritics
#
#   The keysym dead_stroke was previously used for the horizontal dash overlay,
#   a.k.a. bar, given that one dead key is not enough to support both "/" and
#   "-" shaped diacritics, so to cater for Karl Pentzlin’s new German T3 layout
#   (DIN 2137:2012), dead_longsolidusoverlay was added based on the name of the
#   diacritic used to decompose negated math symbols: "̸" U0338 COMBINING LONG
#   SOLIDUS OVERLAY. (Letters like Oslash "Ø" U00D8 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH
#   STROKE are not decomposed.) The T3 also required another three new keysyms:
#   dead_aboveverticalline, dead_belowverticalline, dead_lowline, although none
#   of these has any precomposed letters, and Windows’ TSF dead keys are unable
#   to support decomposed (NFD/NFKD) letters. But the stroke-bar disambiguation
#   made a good point for adding the “extra dead elements for German T3 layout”
#   alongside the use of vertical line below, and its alternate representation
#   vertical line above, in Yoruba and in other languages.
#
#   Initially, the new keysym was called "dead_longsolidus", and "dead_stroke"
#   was disruptively renamed to "dead_shortstroke" as well.
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=85370
#
#   Alas, en_US.UTF-8/Compose has not been updated in the wake. One decade down
#   the road, while dead_longsolidusoverlay was (expectedly) in use at least in
#   Cimbali’s partial implementation (skipping unsupported dead key content) of
#   the newly standardized French AZERTY (NF Z71-300, https://norme-azerty.fr/,
#   `/usr/share/X11/symbols/fr(afnor)`), that explicitly supports "Ł" U0141 and
#   "ł" U0142 as well as "Ƚ" U023D and "ƚ" U019A (another casing letter pair is
#   less completely enumerated in the standard), Ghost User (@ghost) managed to
#   toss it out of keysymdef.h.
#   https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/xorgproto/-/merge_requests/70
#
#   The resulting regression was bluntly released in libxkbcommon 1.6.0.
#   https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2023-October/043121.html
#   https://www.reddit.com/r/openSUSE/comments/17guwgm/comment/k6p6ul2/
#
#   In Cimbali’s French AFNOR layout, dead_longsolidusoverlay was replaced with
#   a second instance of dead_stroke.
#
#   So, none of the 2 French standard layouts can be implemented anymore, using
#   XKB named keysyms only.
#
#   The outcome is not so bad, as dead_stroke is stroke again, while *dead_bar
#   becomes the ninth Private Use Area keysym used for dead keys in this file:
#   UEFD8, after UEFD0..UEFD7, plus UEFD9, UEFDA.
#
#
# # Macron below and line below
#
#   The deadkeysym dead_lowline is not used to input precomposed letters having
#   “WITH LINE BELOW” in their name, given in the Latin Extended Additional
#   block, “the names "WITH LINE BELOW" refer to a macron below the letter.”
#   https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_1E00.html
#
#   These letters are input using dead_belowmacron, which may be virtualized by
#   double press of dead_macron.
#   See #^# MACRON_BELOW
#
#   Letters with a real line below are used in languages of Gabon and in Oneida
#   and require a line-below dead key, standardized in ISO/IEC 9995-11, where
#   dead keys output combining diacritics to begin with, for post-processing by
#   applications on Windows that part 11 of the standard has been designed for.
#   See #^# LINE_BELOW
#
#   As the output only consists in an added combining diacritic to any letter
#   typed after, implementing this dead key on non-Windows keyboards requires
#   knowing the list of letters expected to be supported.
#
#   (Although U0332 COMBINING LOW LINE is defined as connecting, it may not be
#   used to underline a text span in plain text, due to vertical alignment
#   issues under lowercase letters with descender.)
#
#
# # Hook, hook above and retroflex hook
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, dead_hook is used both for hook and hook above.
#   The consequence is that en_US.UTF-8/Compose is unable to support "Ƴ" U01B3
#   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH HOOK and "ƴ" U01B4 LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH
#   HOOK. Hence the need for a keysym dedicated to letters with hook above,
#   e.g. *dead_abovehook.
#
#   Another hook dead key is added because new-school input composition takes
#   advantage of the brace symmetry to alleviate the overloaded dead_hook by
#   adding *dead_retroflexhook.
#
#
# # Proposed additional dead key syms
#
#   These 8 additional dead keys are required for supporting the Latin script,
#   and also for consistency with the 30 ASCII symbols and punctuation mapped
#   on level 3 of the keys in rows B..D, columns 1..10.
#
#   *dead_abovehook (see # # Hook, hook above and retroflex hook)
#   *dead_bar (see # # Bar and stroke diacritics)
#   *dead_group (this AZERTY has also an extra key for this dead key)
#   *dead_flag (regional indicator letters, U1F1E6..U1F1FF)
#   *dead_retroflexhook (see # # Hook, hook above and retroflex hook)
#   *dead_reversed (~50 Latin letters)
#   *dead_subscript (smallcap when the base letter is uppercase)
#   *dead_superscript (used as modifier letter and abbreviation indicator)
#   *dead_turned (~70); inverted (20) or sideways (8) on double press
#
#   An alias is also proposed:
#
#   *dead_circled for the virtual dead_greek double press
#
#
# # Dead keys not included in keysymdef.h
#
#   Some additional dead keys proposed for mapping on an fr-FR keyboard are
#   listed below.
#   See # # Dead characters for portability
#
#   <UEFD0> : "①"   *dead_group, for 12 additional groups (0-based). Multi_key: ¦#
#   <UEFD1> : "^"   *dead_superscript, used in phonetics and as abbreviation
#                   indicatrs. Multi_key: ¦^
#                   As abbreviation indicators, superscripts need to be on live
#                   keys.
#                   dead_circumflex is not « ¦^ » but « ¦< » in new-school Compose.
#   <UEFD2> : "_"   *dead_subscript is required for phonetics as it traditionally
#                   also includes small caps.
#   <UEFD3> : "ẻ"   *dead_abovehook, required for disambiguation with dead_hook. Multi_key: ¦]
#   <UEFD4> : "ɖ"   *dead_retroflexhook, required for disambiguation, consistent with the

#   <UEFD5> : "ᴚ"   *dead_turned, technically easiest transform. ~70 instances. Multi_key: ¦%
#                   double-press: inverted (20 instances) or sideways (8 letters) in Latin;
#                   inverted and sideways have an empty intersection. Multi_key: ¦%
#   <UEFD6> : "ᴙ"   *dead_reversed, second-most frequent transform. ~50 (Latin). Multi_key: ¦\
#   <UEFD7> : "⚐"   *dead_flag — The Regional Indicator Symbols dead key. Multi_key: ¦=
#   <UEFD8> : "ħ"   *dead_bar for barred letters, i.e. with a horizontal stroke. Multi_key: ¦-
#
#
# # Order of dead key lists
#
#   There is no obvious order for the dead keys, since keysyms are unintuitive
#   or non-existent, most code points are arbitrary and unmnemonic, and common
#   names are challenging due to language and conventions. By lack of anything
#   better, dead keys are ordered following the keyboard layout as in the list
#   below.
#   See # # Dead key layout overview
#
#   That order is based on the assumption that those ASCII symbols are mapped
#   in a stable manner. However, prior to v2, this ASCII map was unstable.
#   See Compose.yml  Acknowledgements
#
#
# # Proposed dead key layout for AZERTY keyboards
#
#   30 out of 32 ASCII symbols and punctuation are mapped on level 3 of keys
#   (B..D)(01..10), and 28 dead keys are mapped on level 4 of the same keys
#   as the ASCII characters used to emulate those dead keys by multikey, using
#   new-school input composition. New-school composition is designed to fully
#   support the Latin script.
#
#   One of those two dead keys that is not mapped on the same key as the symbol
#   used to emulate it by multikey is dead_abovedot, mapped on P, where level 3
#   ampersand is unrelated. However, dead_abovedot’s multikey equivalent period
#   is mapped on level 5, for use as a decimal separator on the extended AltFr-
#   level numpad, alongside comma on key C10 (M on AZERTY).
#
#   The other exception is dead_cedilla on the comma key B07, where level 3 is
#   used for question mark, that is not an equivalent of any dead key either.
#
#   As a result, most dead keys are mnemonically related to the ASCII symbols
#   mapped on the same keys, the more as all level 4 positions are available as
#   dead keys because none of them is used for an uppercase letter, the less as
#   in the Windows implementation of these keyboard layouts, AltGr level 3 is
#   an additional level, 0x10 or Right Oyayubi, without Caps Lock support, but
#   free from the numerous conflicts with application shortcuts affecting the
#   AltGr level because on Windows, this is emulated by Ctrl + Alt. These
#   conflicts may be fixed on application level, as in MS Word.
#
#   That is one reason why levels 3 and 4 are not used for casing characters,
#   consistently with Mark Durdin’s advice about “Robust key message handling
#   in Windows”.
#   https://blog.keyman.com/2008/06/robust-key-mess/
#
#   Each dead key has a stable mapping on level 4 according to the table below.

#
# # Order of mixed dead keys
#
#   Dead key combinations, called chained dead keys on Windows, are actionable
#   both ways for two diacritics, except when order matters, for diacritics to
#   be positioned above, stacked in one order or the other way around, e.g. on
#   "Ṻ" U1E7A and "ṻ" U1E7B versus "Ǖ" U01D5 and "ǖ" U01D6, or when a Multi_key
#   equivalent would conflict with another input method, e.g. "Ḉ" U1E08 and "ḉ"
#   U1E09 with "ʻ" U02BB by dead_acute, "Ǘ" U01D7 and "ǘ" U01D8 with "‚" U201A.
#
#   Diacritic or transformational dead keys applied to letters in groups are
#   to be hit first, before the group dead key. That behavior is consistent,
#   it helps streamline code and maintenance, and it prevents conflicts.
#
#
# # Quotation mark input method
#
#   A complete set of current curly quotes is input on unshifted keys, thanks
#   to the fact that both the involved dead keys and the base characters have
#   base level mappings.
#
#   This is part of the dead key enhancement based on considering each dead key
#   a group selector activating the "<dead key> group", e.g. "circumflex group"
#   or "dead_circumflex group".
#
#   Overview
#
#       Acute accent: high           closing or opening   U2019, U201D
#       See #*# ACUTE
#
#       Circumflex:   turned high    opening or closing   U2018, U201C
#       See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#       Diaeresis:    low            opening              U201A, U201E
#       See #*# DIAERESIS
#
#   Additionally, some rare quotation marks are also supported, with a dead key
#   that is not on the base level:
#
#       Grave accent: reversed high  opening              U201B, U201F
#       See #*# GRAVE
#
#       Double grave, or diaeresis + grave:    reversed low      U2E42
#
#   This input method is fostered by using dead_doubleacute, consistently with
#   ASCII double quote replaced with EuroSign on key D03, level 3. This dead
#   key prevents conflicts by not having many base characters.
#   See #*# DOUBLE_ACUTE
#
#   The rightsinglequotemark base character takes into account that the ASCII
#   apostrophe on key E04 is replaced with rightsinglequotemark, to enhance UX
#   in French mode, i.e. when ModLock is off. This is also an unconflicting
#   base character fostering this quotation mark input method.
#
#   ASCII apostrophe is supported alongside for interoperability, and because
#   it is mapped on the base level of key E05 next to rightsinglequotemark. The
#   conflicts of multikey equivalents with CIRCUMFLEX&ACUTE, DIAERESIS&ACUTE,
#   are fixed by hitting these dead keys the other way around.
#   See # # CIRCUMFLEX&ACUTE
#   See # # ACUTE&DIAERESIS
#   See # # DIAERESIS&ACUTE
#   See # # ACUTE&GRAVE, GRAVE&ACUTE
#
#   The Unicode informative aliases are appended to the Unicode identifiers of
#   single and double apostrophe quotation marks and comma quotation marks.
#   A Unicode informative alias has been given when the Unicode character name
#   (used as an identifier) was considered suboptimal.
#
#   Ornamental quotation marks are input by diacritical dead key followed by
#   group dead key.
#
#   SMP quotation mark ornaments U1F676.. are not supported, for cross-platform
#   compatibility.

#
#
# # Spacing modifier letters and clones of diacritics
#
#   An input method based on overtyping reportedly existed on very old systems.
#   Most of the spacing diacritics in Latin-1 were replaced with letters in
#   Latin-15, but other symbols were replaced too, while a diacritic remained.
#
#   The Unicode Standard states in §7.9 that it is not clear whether diacritics
#   were combining or standalone. Using the latter as dead characters (Windows)
#   or terminators (macOS) in dead keys is not possible consistently throughout
#   and is a reason why many keyboard layouts are not streamlined, and dead key
#   behavior is inconsistent. The most outstanding example is a dedicated 'ê'
#   key, when 'ê' is better supported by configuring the circumflex accent dead
#   key accordingly, with "ê" U00EA as a dead character. Other examples include
#   unrelated dead characters for hook, horn, and for most combinations.
#
#   Unicode added U02D8..U02DD to the Latin-1 diacritics merely for roundtrip
#   compatibility with pre-existing character sets.
#
#   Both NBSP (AltGr + spacebar) and NBTSP (AltFr + spacebar) are used as base
#   characters.
#
#   Since DIAERESIS and CEDILLA do exist only in Latin-1, they are accessible
#   both ways. By contrast, Latin-1 MACRON and ACUTE ACCENT are duplicates of
#   modifier letters (by NBTSP) and are accessible by NBSP exclusively. Then,
#   ASCII symbols GRAVE ACCENT, CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT, TILDE are included as well.
#
#
# # Dead characters for portability
#
#   This representative sign works on Windows as the so-called dead character.
#   On MacOS it is the terminator. Both OSes output it when the base character
#   is not listed with the current dead key, prior to outputting the unchanged
#   base character itself. XCompose, by contrast, has no output in this case.
#
#   Traditionally, this character is output in isolation on hitting space after
#   a dead key, but space is now reserved for the related combining diacritic,
#   and this is inappropriate as a dead character, because dead characters must
#   be spacing so as to be clearly distinguishable and keep user experience on
#   a correct level, also with respect to the use on macOS of these characters
#   as terminators displayed on a yellow background during an ongoing sequence,
#   and in support of the new XKB feature displaying underlined dead characters
#   (picked in a system file), as opposed to Windows not providing feedback.
#
#   The topmost reason for picking the base character from the dead key output
#   is that an Ê-key emulation on the circumflex accent dead key requires ê as
#   a dead character in dead_circumflex, and so does the Ç-key emulation for ç
#   in dead_cedilla. But this is limited to Windows.
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#   See #*# CEDILLA
#
#   Moreover, many diacritics do not have a spacing clone.
#
#   Consistently, dead keys have their dead character picked from their output.
#
#   For dead_tilde, the dead character base letter is "e" for consistency with
#   dead_belowtilde, that is precomposed only with e, i, u, and for equity, as
#   opposed to picking one of ã, ñ, õ, and thus favoring either Portuguese or
#   Spanish. The ẽ also makes for a consistent mnemonic since tilde ends in e.
#   See #*# TILDE
#   See #^# MIDDLE_TILDE
#
#   For portability, the dead characters are defined in the dead key headings:
#
#       #*# SUPERSCRIPT
#       #   *dead_superscript UEFD1
#       #   Multi_key: ¦^
#       #   Dchar: "^" U005E
#
#   A projected transpiler shall read in this dead character and use it for the
#   DEADTRANS function calls on Windows, supporting an implementable subset (no
#   strings). That is yet to be implemented (idea 2023-11-06T0603+0100).
#
#   For documentation, a list of dead character candidates is provided here.
#   For natively unsupported dead keys, a keysym candidate is proposed as well.

#
#   The multikey sequences by contrast are built using generic dead characters
#   in a private use area, because there are too many of them, and it is better
#   to have a .notdef box output on failure rather than an unintended character
#   or two of them (on Windows).
#
#   Moreover, chained dead keys require as many dead characters as dead keys
#   involved. As a result, support for this scheme is about to be dropped.
#
#
# # Combining diacritics
#
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose has combining diacritics with <nobreakspace>, probably
#   assuming that both dead keys and NBSP are on level 3, while <space> yields
#   a legacy spacing character as far as this is available; not for dead_hook,
#   dead_belowcomma, dead_doubleacute properly, and severl other dead keys.
#
#   Those among these spacing characters that are in the ASCII range, as ^, ~,
#   ` are not usefully generated by dead key, because they should be easily
#   accessible on live keys.
#
#   Hence it is proposed to use space as a base character to get the combining
#   diacritic throughout, as implemented since 2010 on J. ‘Mach’ Wust’s 
#   US Custom keyboard layout for macOS:
#   http://uscustom.sourceforge.net/
#
#   Indeed the Unicode Standard version 11.0.0, section 5.2, page 220 states:
#
#      A common implementation for the input of combining character sequences
#      is the use of dead keys. These keys match the mechanics used by
#      typewriters to generate such sequences through overtyping the base
#      character after the nonspacing mark. In computer implementations,
#      keyboards enter a special state when a dead key is pressed for the
#      accent and emit a precomposed character only when one of a limited
#      number of “legal” base characters is entered. It is straightforward
#      to adapt such a system to emit combining character sequences or
#      precomposed characters as needed.
#
#      Typists, especially in the Latin script, are trained on systems that
#      work using dead keys. However, many scripts in the Unicode Standard
#      (including the Latin script) may be implemented according to the
#      handwriting sequence, in which users type the base character first,
#      followed by the accents or other nonspacing marks (see Figure 5-4).
#
#   As a result, keyboard layouts should feature dead keys as well as easy
#   access to combining marks. Alternative input method for combining marks:
#   https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/Phonetic_symbols__diacritics.html
#
#   Following a principle used in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, the most synergistic
#   character after the default mappings of dead keys on level 4, ZWSP,
#   duplicates the combining diacritics. Conversely, the NBSP is repurposed to
#   yield spacing diacritics as does en_US.UTF-8/Compose with ordinary space.
#
#   "¤" U00A4 # CURRENCY SIGN is an exception to the rule.
#
#   This list supports combining diacritics from U0300 to U0339 plus U1DCB.
#   Items are ordered by dead keys. Combined dead keys are listed last.
#
#
# # Composed diacriticized letters
#
#   The XCompose compiler does not parse results defined as multiple keysyms.
#   Composed letters must be defined as literal strings without keysyms.
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, the only composed Latin letter is the uppercase and
#   lowercase "j" with acute accent by dead_acute or by multikey with prepended
#   or appended ASCII apostrophe or Latin-1 acute:
#
#       "J́"   # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER J U004A with COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT U0301
#       "j́"   # LATIN SMALL LETTER J U006A with COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT U0301
#
#   Due to a technical limitation on Windows, caused by defining the wrong data
#   type for dead key output i.e. for the DEADTRANS function’s return value, we
#   cannot get composed letters nor characters from a Supplemental Multilingual
#   Plane output by dead keys in the Text Services Framework of Windows. Hence,
#   this section is not cross-platform compatible.

#   on the Unicode public mailing list in 2016.

#
#   Sequences with Ɛ, ɛ and Ɔ, ɔ keysyms are for use on the Francophone Africa
#   semiautomatic keyboard layout “kbfrAFs” and its remapped variant “kbfrAFsr”
#   that have live keys for open e (Latin epsilon) and open o.
#
#   "M" and "m" with grave accent, included in the shared list, are moved to
#   dead_grave for consistency.

# # Order of dead keys
#
#   Dead keys in this file are ordered following the AZERTY keyboard layout.
#   See # # Actionable dead key layout for Latin keyboards
#
#   Heading levels are differentiated, in that the main dead keys with mappings
#   on keys are prefixed `#*# `, the dead keys virtualized by double or triple,
#   rarely quadruple press are prefixed `#^# `, and the other dead keys `# # `.
#
#   Dead keys are further ordered following this scheme:
#
#       1.    #*# Main dead key
#       2.    # # Dead key in group
#       3.    # # Dead key combination with one or more other dead keys
#       4.    #^# Dead key virtualized by multiple press
#
#   The order of base characters matters, too, since this file is also used for
#   documentation: spaces, quotedbl, apostrophes, other symbols/punctuation[1],
#   digits, letters. As a result, combining marks and spacing clones of
#   diacritics are listed first, quotation marks come next.
#
#   [1] For consistency and predictability, the other punctuation and the other
#       symbols are ordered following the keyboard layout.
#       See # # Order of dead key lists
#
#
# # Lenient group selection
#
#   Diacritical dead keys may combine with the group dead key mainly to support
#   diacriticized letters in the letter groups. Empty lower groups are used for
#   redundant mappings of higher groups. The goal is to not require activating
#   the exact group.
#
#   This is part of the streamlined user experience as a design principle.
#   Another, unusual term is “un-screwed-up” meaning that screwing things up
#   is avoided, if possible; hopefully wherever possible.

#*# SUPERSCRIPT
#   *dead_superscript UEFD1
#   Multi_key: ¦^
#   Dchar: "^" U005E
#
#   In Unicode CLDR, French has ordinal indicators ᵈ, ᵉ, ʳ, ˢ since v34 (2018).
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/release-34/common/main/fr.xml#L1421
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/release-42/common/main/fr.xml#L1526
#
#   Superscript lowercase letters are most extensively used as abbreviation
#   indicators in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, spoken by one
#   third of the world’s population. Therefore, these letters are on live keys.
#   Support for diacriticized abbreviation indicators is straightforward in the
#   Unicode character encoding model, using combining diacritics.
#   See #^# Legacy ordinal indicators
#
#   Superscript small q is part of Unicode since v14.0 released in 2020.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20117-modifier-letter-suppt.pdf
#   There had been an attempt to encode superscript q in isolation, with a good
#   rationale based on two street signs photographed in Paris, pointing to the
#   National Library: “Biblio𐞥ᵘᵉ Nationale”.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2010/10230-modifier-q.pdf
#   One year later, in 2011, a new take argued that the full set of superscript
#   small and capital letters is convenient for keyboard layout design, as this
#   would improve the related user experience.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2011/11208-n4068.pdf
#   The first proposal encountered strong headwinds from the industry.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2010/10315-comment.pdf
#   It was immediately defended by its author during the UTC meeting.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2010/10316-cmts.pdf
#   Both attempts to complete the Latin superscript small letters failed.
#
#   The superscript uppercase alphabet is less complete. Yet some of these are
#   used in orthographies. In 2020 and 2021, more uppercase letters were added:
#   C "ꟲ" UA7F2, F "ꟳ" UA7F3, Q "ꟴ" UA7F4.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20251-mod-latin.pdf
#   L2/20-251 is cited in the Script Ad Hoc Working Group Report L2/21-016r.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2021/21016r-script-adhoc-rept.pdf
#
#   Superscript uppercase S, X, Y, Z still missing after a proposal advising to
#   encode them all are for now replaced with "∄" U2204 THERE DOES NOT EXIST.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02141-n2419-uralic-phonetic.pdf#page=5
#   See #*# SUBSCRIPT
#
#   Despite the consensus about including superscript letters in Unicode for
#   phonetic notation, making abbreviation indicators plain text is fiercely
#   opposed by members of the Consortium, for software marketing reasons. And
#   when character names on a MODIFIER LETTER basis were introduced, these were
#   adopted as the new norm for “superscript”. Meanwhile, “subscript” remained
#   unchanged, meaning that preformatted superscript letters should not be used
#   in lieu of formatted letters. But the move was biased, since superscript is
#   a means to carry semantics and is therefore eligible for plain text support
#   in Unicode. Duly disguising subscript likewise was dropped, probably due to
#   running out of technical terms.
#
#   Followed by quotedbl, apostrophe or rightsinglequotemark, dead_superscript
#   yields high curly quotation marks U201D, U2019 (closing or opening) exactly
#   like dead_acute does, and dead_tilde as of "”" U201D, for more resilient
#   keyboard layouts, e.g. with dead_superscript on the base level with respect
#   to a need for dumbed-down layout drivers to cater for Windows shipping some
#   malware designed to destroy the reputation of more complete layouts.

#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   To populate the diacritic slot, "̅" U0305 COMBINING OVERLINE is included,
#   with a mnemonic referring to "̲" U0332 COMBINING LOW LINE that fills this
#   slot in the SUBSCRIPT dead key, rather than duplicates of the set of
#   circumflexes already provided in dead_circumflex. Consistently, the spacing
#   clone is "‾" U203E, that is also supported on live key.

#   This is based on the small cap semantics of the subscript dead key.
#
#   The fraction slash is supported alongside as a workaround for incomplete
#   keyboard layouts lacking a live key position for U2044. The superscript or
#   subscript dead keys alone cannot include a slash as a base character due to
#   numerous conflicts with math symbols. Yet another input method is included
#   in the slash-shaped set supported by dead_stroke, in slot 4.

#
#   The rotation angle may be 180° as for TURNED letters, or 90° i.e. SIDEWAYS.
#
#   "ɟ" U025F LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS J WITH STROKE being “typographically a
#   turned f, but better thought of as a form of j” (Unicode Code Charts), for
#   consistency, it is supported as such, but for convenience also as a turned
#   f. Since the Claudian letter "Ⅎ" U2132 also has a lowercase form "ⅎ" U214E,
#   that is intended to meet Unicode casing requirements, the uppercase slot is
#   used for the related Lisu letter, and the set of Claudian letters is moved
#   to the double press dead key used for inverted, sideways and other turned.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudian_letters
#   See #^# INVERTED
#   See # # DOT_ABOVE&STROKE
#
#   Old Lisu letters are also supported, as they are repurposed for typesetting
#   turned Latin capital letters, also upright for centrally symmetric letters.
#   For an example see the “Propulsé par” (“Powered by”) mention at the bottom:
#   https://humanisme-renaissance.droz.org
#
#   Old Lisu has turned glyphs for A..L, N..P, R..V, X..Z because Q is not used
#   at all, and turned M and W are confusable. "𑾰" U11FB0 has been encoded late
#   and is therefore outside the BMP.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2008/08019-lisu.pdf
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2018/18338r2-lisu-letter-yha.pdf
#
#   The TURNED dead key supports Lisu letters looking like turned Latin letters
#   or like the centrally symmetric H, I, N, O, S, X, Z since these may be used
#   alongside for consistency. But the other Lisu letters, those that cannot be
#   used as turned Latin letters, are not supported, as this works by dead key,
#   meaning that this is not fit for writing Lisu. But due to conflicts, TURNED
#   double press is used for a fuller set.
#
#   Although "Ǝ" U018E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER REVERSED E is used as a turned E,
#   its usual glyph is a genuine reversed E for aesthetics, unlike what is done
#   for Lisu.
#   See #*# REVERSED
#
#   Turned punctuation for Spanish is supported both by turned (single press)
#   and inverted (double press) dead keys, to meet expectations based on names.
#
#   The opening parenthesis yields the character tie "⁀" U2040, since this may
#   be considered sideways, or like a vertical parenthesis. The undertie
#   "‿" U203F would conflict with "𐞡" U107A1 by its multikey equivalent, but
#   it is supported in the double press virtual dead key *dead_inverted. Both
#   "⁀" U2040 and "‿" U203F are also in group 12 of "(" and ")".

#
#   For intuitivity, the Polynesian ʻeta, Hawaiʻian ʻokina can also be input as
#   if it were a turned rightsinglequotemark despite being a letter. Apostrophe
#   is also supported as a base character for this input method.
#   See # # D07 apostrophe
#
#   As a diacritic, "̒" U0312 COMBINING TURNED COMMA ABOVE is included, and its
#   spacing counterpart "ʻ" U02BB MODIFIER LETTER TURNED COMMA alongside (but a
#   better option for typing a U02BB is using group 2 of grave), with no-break
#   space or no-break thin space as a base character.

#   This supports the full set of those among the Old Lisu letters that can be
#   used for writing in turned Latin letters, i.e. without M, Q, W, except for
#   "ꓞ" UA4DE, that is in the single press dead key for the sake of "ɟ" U025F.
#   See #*# TURNED
#
#   Therefore, this supports the Claudian letter "Ⅎ" U2132 that has a lowercase
#   form "ⅎ" U214E, intended to meet Unicode casing requirements, and thus less
#   appropriate for support in the single press *dead_turned, where "ɟ" U025F
#   is more convenient. The other Claudian letters are "Ↄ" U2183, "ↄ" U2184 and
#   "Ⱶ" U2C75, "ⱶ" U2C76.

#
#   The two parentheses yield the two underties, one of which is inverted:
#   "⁔" U2054, "‿" U203F. For mnemonic, these are like sideways, or vertical
#   parentheses. "⁀" U2040 and "‿" U203F are also in group 12 of "(" and ")".
#
#   As a diacritic, "̕" U0315 COMBINING COMMA ABOVE RIGHT is included, with the
#   rationale that turning twice may be used to represent a shift to the right.
#   Not "̓" U0313 COMBINING COMMA ABOVE, as this is supported in
#   dead_belowcomma double press.
#   See #^# COMMA_ABOVE
#
#   As a spacing clone, letter apostrophe "ʼ" U02BC is picked invariably.

#   This dedicated dead key, supported by XKB, is required to prevent conflicts
#   due to the dead key based quotation mark input method.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   The DOUBLE_ACUTE dead key is also required for consistency with the symbols
#   mapped on level 3, and with the new-school Compose scheme mapping dead keys
#   and ASCII symbols except ampersand and question mark bijectively.
#   See # # Introducing new-school input composition
#
#   Double acute has no reported usage outside Unicode precomposed letters.
#   https://www.frathwiki.com/Double_Acute_Accent
#
#   With digits, dead_doubleacute acts as a shortcut for double circled numbers
#   with “double” mnemonic. Double arrows have their redundancy on *dead_flag.
#   See #^# DOUBLE_CIRCLED
#   See #*# FLAG
#
#   Multikey sequences with quotedbl are duplicated with EuroSign, to account
#   for the mapping of EuroSign instead of quotedbl for compliance with current
#   hardware and the European Commission’s recommendation.

#   Dchar: "ẽ" U1EBD
#
#   The tilde dead key supports the "”" U201D quotation mark, reduntantly
#   with acute accent, for more resilient keyboard layouts.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   Lithuanian requires a hard dot on i and j. The sequences with dot above are
#   a workaround, since the hard dot on i and j is a feature of Lithuanian, and
#   should not depend on user input, but on font settings instead.
#
#   All letters annotated as for Lithuanian in this file are courtesy:
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2012/12026r-n4191-lithuanian.pdf
#
#   The tilde dead key supports daggers, because it is mapped on key T due to
#   alphabetic mnemonic, and daggers are tied to T by shape-based mnemonic.
#   The full set of daggers is available by digits 1 through 6 with shape-based
#   mnemonic for simple, double and triple daggers, by 1 through 3, and numpad
#   positional mnemonic for left/right guard daggers, by 4 and 6 respectively,
#   around the turned dagger by 5.
#   Umihotaru’s 'Nishiki-teki' font supports "⹋" U2E4B TRIPLE DAGGER.
#
#   The remaining digits are used for the four tack modifier letters that are
#   no superscripts despite the "modifier letter" part in their names. since
#   modifier letters are not necessarily superscript. Positional mnemonic is
#   based on the numpad as far as possible in the remaining slots:
#
#      7    "꭪" UAB6A MODIFIER LETTER LEFT TACK
#      8    "˔" U02D4 MODIFIER LETTER UP TACK
#      9    "꭫" UAB6B MODIFIER LETTER RIGHT TACK
#      0    "˕" U02D5 MODIFIER LETTER DOWN TACK
#
#   The tilde dead key also has intuitive support for the swung dash "⁓" U2053,
#   with underscore and the quotation dash U2015 as base characters.
#
#   The double diacritic "͠" U0360 has emdash as a mnemonic base character, and
#   the question mark as an unconflicting ASCII alternative, for a consistent
#   input method across all dead keys featuring a double diacritic.
#
#   Combining tilde halves above – "︢" UFE22, "︣" UFE23 – are supported on all
#   fully available base letters for a streamlined user experience.
#
#   Halves of combining diacritics are also supported in the tilde and
#   ampersand virtual dead key.

# # TILDE&AMPERSAND
#   Dchar: "ǂ" U01C2
#
#   This new virtual dead key uses the synergy of the dead_tilde main instance,
#   on key D11 level 3, with the ampersand on D10 level 3, according to the new
#   ASCII symbols map on alphabetic keys.
#
#   The TILDE&AMPERSAND dead key is partly dedicated to African click letters
#   hopefully coming into the benefit of a consistent input method. Three of
#   these have Latin equivalents in Zulu and are mapped on these letters, while
#   another two use graphic mnemonics based on O and H, thought of as sideways.
#   These are case insensitive except q for intuitivity:
#
#       c  "ǀ" U01C0 LATIN LETTER DENTAL CLICK
#       x  "ǁ" U01C1 LATIN LETTER LATERAL CLICK
#       q  "ǃ" U01C3 LATIN LETTER RETROFLEX CLICK (post)alveolar click (IPA)
#       Q  "𐞹" U107B9 MODIFIER LETTER RETROFLEX CLICK WITH RETROFLEX HOOK
#
#       H  "ǂ" U01C2 LATIN LETTER ALVEOLAR CLICK  palatoalveolar click (IPA)
#       O  "ʘ" U0298 LATIN LETTER BILABIAL CLICK
#
#   Other parts of this dead key are dedicated to combining diacritics, with
#   the ampersand carrying the "combining" semantics.
#   See # # Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols in block U20D0 used in mathematics
#
#   While the mnemonics based on ASCII symbols are obvious, the mnemonics based
#   on letters use a new-school French AZERTY and its alphabetic key ASCII map,
#   except for the annuity diacritic "⃧" U20E7 mapped on case insensitive A.
#   The list has been reordered alphabetically for consistency, but it started
#   with D and F for opening and closing parentheses "᫁" U1AC1, "᫃" U1AC3,
#   "᫂" U1AC2, "᫄" U1AC4, using uppercase for above, lowercase for below.
#
#   Half macrons and tildes start on the keys that their multikey equivalents
#   "|" and "~" are on, for the variants above: "︤" UFE24, "︥" UFE25, "︢" UFE22
#   and "︣" UFE23. But for these, the semantics of uppercase/lowercase is used
#   for the left and right halves, with the rationale that uppercase carries
#   semantics of start when it is in titlecase position. The variants below are
#   on a letter whose key is below M or T on the keyboard: G for the half tilde
#   "︩" UFE29 and the half tilde "︪" UFE2A, N for the half macron "︫" UFE2B and
#   the half macron "︬" UFE2C. This assumes a French AZERTY, where M comes
#   after L, and N is the last letter in the row below the row that M is in.
#
#   The ligature halves below are on L: "︧" UFE27, "︨" UFE28, while those above
#   – "︠" UFE20, "︡" UFE21 – are on P, as the P key is nearly above the L key,
#   and it benefits from the ampersand mnemonic.
#
#   By contrast, the "᫇" U1AC7 and "᷹" U1DF9 diacritics use graphic mnemonics
#   on case insensitive W and U.
#
#   As of the combining diacritic and its spacing clone, the picks are the most
#   iconic of both classes, for the combining diacritics  "⃤" U20E4 COMBINING
#   ENCLOSING UPWARD POINTING TRIANGLE, and for the spacing letters, "ǃ" U01C3
#   LATIN LETTER RETROFLEX CLICK, "q" in Zulu; while the "ǂ" U01C2 LATIN LETTER
#   ALVEOLAR CLICK, not used in Zulu but fairly unambiguous, may be a good fit
#   as a dead character.

#
#   This dead key results from the merger of tilde below and middle tilde. But
#   given that middle tilde with 14 letters (casing counted twice, "ɵ" U0275
#   included) outweighs tilde below with 6 letters, middle tilde makes the dead
#   key name.
#
#   The tilde below however keeps making the consistent combining and modifier
#   pair "̰" U0330, "˷" U02F7, while the combining tilde overlay "̴" U0334 is
#   supported by ampersand and by triple press.
#   See #^# DOUBLE_MIDDLE_TILDE
#
#   Lowercase of "Ɵ" U019F LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH MIDDLE TILDE is
#   "ɵ" U0275 LATIN SMALL LETTER BARRED O.
#   See #*# BAR
#
#   Combining tilde halves below – "︩" UFE29, "︪" UFE2A – are supported by all
#   fully available base letters for a streamlined user experience.
#
#   Halves of combining diacritics are also supported in the virtual dead key
#   called “tilde and ampersand”.

#   The Greek letter dead key is present on several layouts and supported by
#   XKB thanks to the French ergonomic BÉPO keyboard layout.
#   https://bepo.fr/wiki/Lettres_grecques
#   https://bepo.fr/wiki/Version_1.1rc2#Touches_mortes
#
#   The Greek dead key is mapped on D06 with a mnemonic based on Y as 'Greek I'
#   translating its French name: i grec.
#   See #+# GROUP_6
#
#   The list conforms to ISO/IEC 9995-9, that is consistent with the Greek
#   keyboard layout.
#
#   When dead_greek was designed and added to en_US.UTF-8/Compose far ahead of
#   ISO/IEC 9995-9, mappings were not yet synced with the Greek keyboard. That
#   is the reason of the discrepancies between en_US.UTF-8/Compose and current
#   keyboard standards, like NF Z71-300:2019 in sync with ISO/IEC 9995-9:2016.

#   The empty place on Q is used for the theta symbol preferred in Romani when
#   only the glyph is considered, regardless of word processing concerns.

#   Greek subscript letters and small caps letters are also supported.

#   Polytonic Greek is supported alongside to meet eventual user expectations,
#   but due to file size restrictions in the web interface of GitHub, it cannot
#   be included here, for the same reason that to be usably displayed on GitHub
#   on full-fledged web pages rather than merely in plain text, this file needs
#   to be splitted in three partials. The Greek overflow is in part 1.
#   See ### Greek with diacritics
#
#   The diacritic slot is used for the combining ypogegrammeni "ͅ" U0345 as the
#   most likely to be useful and expected, rather than other diacritical marks.
#   So is the spacing clone slot used for "ι" U1FBE rather than "ι" U03B9, that
#   is consistent with Greek encoding but is less expected in this place.

#   For non-letters, dead_greek single press is used as a dead key for CIRCLED,
#   alongside dead_greek double press virtualizing the ordinary general-purpose
#   *dead_circled.
#   See #^# CIRCLED
#
#   This dead key applies a scheme where zero yields circled number 10. This is
#   consistent with dead_doubleacute yielding double circled numbers.

#   Unlike squared digit emoji, squared letter dingbats are separately encoded.
#   These sequences are based on convenience and T-shape-based mnemonic. These
#   SMP dingbats have limited cross-platform compatibility. For streamlining an
#   implementation, equivalents with inverted color are supported based on this
#   feature and by repurposing lowercase so as to skip the overhead of flagging
#   the sequences for squared like here.

#   dead_greek double press
#   Multi_key: ¦@@
#   Dchar: 
#
#   This scheme starts with zero, since dead_greek double press is not required
#   for double circled digits that have a dedicated dead key and can thus be in
#   dead_greek triple press.
#   See #*# DOUBLE_ACUTE
#   See #^# DOUBLE_CIRCLED
#
#   Circled operators are also supported.
#   See #^# CIRCLED_NUMBER

#   As a diacritic,  "⃝" U20DD is provided, and "⚪" U26AA as a spacing clone.

#   dead_acute
#   Multi_key: ¦'
#   Dchar: "ó" U00F3
#
#   Followed by quotedbl, apostrophe or rightsinglequotemark, dead_acute
#   yields high curly quotation marks U201D, U2019 (closing or opening).
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   J WITH ACUTE is in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, but Ĳ́ ĳ́ with acute is not
#   rendered correctly in some fonts. It should have an accent on each letter
#   making up the digraph.
#   https://glyphsapp.com/learn/localize-your-font-accented-dutch-ij
#
#   Followed by Éé, acute is a shortcut to Ãã for Portuguese with spatial
#   mnemonic on AZERTY, where A is close to É.
#
#   Followed by Àà, acute is a shortcut to Õõ for Portuguese with spatial
#   mnemonic on AZERTY, where O is close to À.
#
#   Comma is not used as a base character, because one way, its multikey
#   equivalent would conflict with acute and cedilla. Nor is period, that
#   has the same issue with acute and dot above.
#   See # # CEDILLA&ACUTE
#   See # # ACUTE&DOT_ABOVE
#
#   The acute accent below virtual dead key is removed as designed to foster
#   a better quotation mark input method, the more as there are no precomposed
#   letters with an acute accent below. Therefore, a virtual dead key is not
#   required. The only two “acute below” characters are supported by ampersand
#   for "̗" U0317 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT BELOW, and by underscore for "ˏ" U02CF
#   MODIFIER LETTER LOW ACUTE ACCENT.
#   See #*# GRAVE
#
#   The primes by digits sequences add to the support by multikey.

#   As a diacritic, the double ring is used, as coming closest to a curl below.
#   Since the combining double ring below has no spacing clone nor any modifier
#   looking close to it, the centered half rings "˒" U02D2, "˓" U02D3 are used
#   instead, with a rationale based on the laterality of the AltFr and AltGr
#   modifier keys involved in typing these left and right half rings this way.

#   As a diacritic, the double ring is used, as coming closest to a flourish.
#   Since the combining double ring below has no spacing clone nor any modifier
#   looking close to it, the centered half rings "˒" U02D2, "˓" U02D3 are used
#   instead, with a rationale based on the laterality of the AltFr and AltGr
#   modifier keys involved in typing these left and right half rings this way.

#
#   A retroflex hook may be referred to as a tail, a hook tail, a right hook.
#
#   "Ꝕ" UA754, "ꝕ" UA755 P WITH SQUIRREL TAIL is made redundant for convenience
#   and ease of input thanks to availability of the P positions.
#   See #^# CURL
#
#   RETROFLEX_HOOK supports the full set of 10 recycling symbols, consistently
#   with the paper symbols in dead_abovedot, with graphic mnemonic based on the
#   shape of the letter O this dead key is on, and the cycling idea.
#   The proximity with DOT_ABOVE on P also has a mnemonic upside.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2000/00292-n2240.pdf
#   See #*# DOT_ABOVE
#   See # # D04 backslash
#
#   For these symbols, the R mnemonic is not possible, since the REVERSED dead
#   key is used for mathematical backslash shaped symbols.
#   See #*# STROKE,
#
#   The spacing modifier slot is populated with "˾" U02FE MODIFIER LETTER OPEN
#   SHELF, by lack of anything more to the point.

#   For L and l, dead_abovedot results in WITH MIDDLE DOT.

#   For i and j, dead_abovedot results in DOTLESS, applying binary logic. As a
#   consequence, dotless letters do not need support on live keys or in groups.

# # Oslash for Danish, Norwegian and other languages
#
#   While ISO layouts have Øø in group 1 of Oo, and Œœ in group 1 of Ee, for
#   intuitivity and predictability both letters Ææ and Œœ are in group 1 of Aa
#   and Oo in this layout, leaving no room for Oslash.
#
#   Oslash has normal support in dead_stroke, but as a convenience for Danish
#   and other languages, Oslash is in group 1 of Ccedilla and Odiaeresis.
#   On AZERTY, Ccedilla is above the O key, while Swiss QWERTZ has also an
#   Odiaeresis live key. In an effort to mitigate the inconvenience of not
#   having Øø in group 1 of Oo, Oslash is additionally in dead_diaeresis,
#   with Ccedilla as a base character again, and good mnemonic since Danish Øø
#   is phonetically equivalent to Swedish Öö.

# # HORIZONTAL BAR for African, Breton and Polynesian variants
#
#   Two positions on key E08 are used for Ɔɔ U0186, U0254 or Ññ U00D1, U00F1,
#   or the macron dead key and the ʻeta "ʻ" U02BB MODIFIER LETTER TURNED COMMA.
#
#   To work around the loss of the key position where the HORIZONTAL BAR dash
#   is mapped, this is in group 1 of case insensitive OPEN O and N WITH TILDE
#   mapped on that key in African and Breton variants respectively. Given that
#   the default mapping of the HORIZONTAL BAR is on shifted E08, the Polynesian
#   variants use U02BB as a base character for HORIZONTAL BAR, while unshifted
#   key E08 or E07 yields the NON-BREAKING HYPHEN based on the macron dead key.
#   See # # NON-BREAKING HYPHEN for Polynesian variants
#   See # # C07 underscore
#
#   The HORIZONTAL BAR Unicode informative alias is “quotation dash”. No doubt
#   the Cambria font makes the most sense of it, giving it a three-quarter em
#   length and making it a four-per-three-em dash. Other fonts use this dash
#   to have a conjoining em dash, while em dash may not be conjoining.

# # NON-BREAKING HYPHEN for Polynesian variants
#
#   As variants for French Polynesia have base level support for dead_macron in
#   lieu of the underscore on E08 or the non-breaking hyphen on E07, the latter
#   is in group 1 of dead_macron.
#
#   On African and Breton variants this feature is unavailable so as to prevent
#   the Caps Lock toggle state from altering the result.

#
# # HORIZONTAL BAR for remapped variants
#
#   Given that in ASCII mode, the underscore is on unshifted key D12, remapped
#   variants use the underscore’s remapped key position on unshifted E07 to get
#   an unshifted position for the non-breaking hyphen, and E06 is dedicated to
#   casing Ùù for consistency even though uppercase support by Caps Lock would
#   be sufficient, while on unremapped variants this is the hyphen key with the
#   non-breaking hyphen on level 2.
#
#   As a consequence, in French mode, underscore has no unshifted key support.
#   To keep running the base level input method for HORIZONTAL BAR in group 1
#   of underscore, non-breaking hyphen works as a base character, too.

# # Long dashes
#
#   Encoded in 2012 for Unicode 6.1, the three-em dash may stand for the author
#   name in bibliographies, and the two-em dash fills gaps from missing letters
#   or words, that the three-em dash may also be used to represent.
#
#   These are documented by Jukka Korpela, who links also to the archive of the
#   Unicode Public Mailing List.

#
#   The TWO-EM DASH and THREE-EM DASH are both in group 1, depending on whether

# # Micro sign
#
#   "µ" U00B5 MICRO SIGN is usually on live keys (key M for mnemonic, key C12
#   for hardware compatibility). It has dead key support here because there is
#   no room in the symbol groups, and most importantly, because the purpose of
#   this fallback is to cope with a malware simulator shipped with Windows that
#   requires incomplete (dumbed-down) keyboard layouts.
#   https://dispoclavier.com/nouvel-azerty/#malware-windows
#
#   In any event and for convenience, the micro sign is thus in group 1 of the
#   greater-than double angle quotation mark, on the same key, level 5, as the
#   group dead key on unremapped layouts of this family, and as the micro sign
#   printed on the C12 keycap of French AZERTY, since angle quotation marks
#   "«" U00AB, "»" U00BB, "‹" U2039, and "›" U203A are on live keys.
#
#   For consistency, the nearby percent sign has a similar facility, and the
#   multicharacter strings with an NBTSP next to the guillemets are supported,
#   too.
#
#   By contrast, the single guillemets are used for "❮" U276E, "❯" U276F.

# # Tabular minus sign
#
#   The FIGURE DASH is a tabular minus sign used in typesetting tables, not in
#   interval notation, although it was recommended for that purpose.
#   https://web.archive.org/web/20210224183416/http://www.technicalauthoring.com/wiki/index.php/Figure_dash
#
#   Since FIGURE DASH occurs in single instances only, it is compatible with
#   dead key input, unlike FIGURE SPACE and PUNCTUATION SPACE that are the
#   tabular digit and punctuation spaces, respectively, and are mapped on live
#   keys B07 (digitspace) and B08 (punctspace), level 7, in ASCII mode.
#
#   FIGURE DASH is not supported on live key to prevent its misuse for interval
#   notation, a use case that "–" U2013 EM DASH is recommended for.

#   https://web.archive.org/web/20180121071439/http://www.technicalauthoring.com/wiki/index.php/Figure_dash
#
#   Unicode does not promote the misuse of FIGURE DASH for interval notation as
#   advocated on the web page cited above, but Unicode did — and still does —
#   promote the misuse of FIGURE SPACE as a numeric group separator, in UAX#14.
#   https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-51.html#NNBSPdoc
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20005-uax14-material.pdf#page=6
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20008-core-text.pdf#page=7
#
#   So it is advisable to stop promoting Unicode-related misuse of any sorts.
#   Following this policy, FIGURE DASH is only supported by dead key in group 1
#   of MINUS SIGN as here, and in the set of dashes and hyphens by multikey.

# # Arrows as on the numpad
#
#   These are needed to palliate a lack of the dedicated or integrated numpad.
#
#   Five sets of arrows and ten arrow emoji have an input method using digits
#   0..9 in groups 2..7. The digits are based on the position of cursor arrows
#   on the numpad on keys 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8. The remaining single headed arrows
#   are extrapolated; double-headed left-right is placed on 5, up-down on 0.
#
#   The arrow emoji are heterogeneous in that the diagonal and bidirectional
#   arrows are basic arrows, whereas the cardinal arrows are picked from the
#   plain arrows. For UX consistency, this mix makes up an extra set.
#
#   Group 1 is not used here, since digits in group 1 are dead keys activating
#   other groups. And groups 8 and 10 are used for mathematical digit symbols:
#   double-struck (U1D7D8..) and sans-serif (U1D7E2..). So groups 9, 11 and 12
#   are used for additional arrow sets: triangle-headed to bar (U2B70..) as of
#   BMP arrows, and the wide-headed light (U1F860..) and very heavy (U1F880..)
#   in the SMP. The sans-serif set U1F850.. is skipped as not providing enough
#   added value with respect to the fact that on most computers (Windows), SMP
#   characters are hard to input inside the TSF using only layout drivers with
#   an inappropriate data type picked for dead key output. 0 and 5 are used to
#   input the high surrogate, since these arrows do not include bidirectionals.
#   The numpad live key level depends on the ModLock toggle state.

#   The generic currency sign "¤" U00A4 however is extensively supported, with

#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, the BENGALI RUPEE MARK requires a thorn live key,

#
#   Breve and inverted breve have each their own dead key for consistency with
#   the ASCII map and the dead key multikey equivalents.
#
#   As inverted breve has only 6×2 precomposed letters, it might be virtualized
#   by dead breve double press. Nevertheless it has a dead key of its own, for
#   consistency with ASCII symbols, and with its XKB keysym dead_invertedbreve.
#
#   Inverted breve has no reported usage outside Unicode precomposed letters.
#   https://www.frathwiki.com/Inverted_Breve
#
#   "˓" U02D3 MODIFIER LETTER CENTRED LEFT HALF RING is mapped to unconflicting
#   and case insensitive C, with its right equivalent in dead_breve.
#
#   This also supports the new U1DF00 LATIN SMALL LETTER FENG DIGRAPH WITH
#   TRILL, because the trill looks like two inverted breves, or a double
#   inverted breve.
#
#   With case insensitive G as a base character, dead_invertedbreve has a
#   shortcut for "⁐" U2050 CLOSE UP.
#   See # # Proofreading mark
#
#   dead_invertedbreve also starts circled numbers, as well as box drawings
#   with rounded corners.
#   See #^# CIRCLED_NUMBER
#   See # # Box drawings with rounded corners
#
#   The double diacritic "͡" U0361 has emdash as a mnemonic base character, and
#   the question mark as an unconflicting ASCII alternative, for a consistent
#   input method across all dead keys featuring a double diacritic.

# # Box drawings with rounded corners
#
#   Rounded corners use dead_invertedbreve and its multikey equivalent ¦( with
#   graphic mnemonic based on the shape of uppercase letter D on C03, that the
#   dead_invertedbreve dead key is on, and with proximity mnemonic, since the
#   box drawings are mainly in dead_breve on key F, C04.

#   is on level 4 of key F, C04, where the closing parenthesis is on level 3.
#
#   The digit position sets the direction clockwise: up, right, down, left;
#   and a digit sets the stroke type: 0 for none,
#                                     1 for light,
#                                     2 for double,
#                                     3 for heavy,
#   as in <1><0><1><0> : "─" U2500 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT HORIZONTAL.
#
#   Multiple dashes are input by the number of dashes, typed once for light,
#   twice for heavy, terminated by "h" for horizontal, or "v" for vertical,
#   as in <3><h> : "┄" U2504 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT TRIPLE DASH HORIZONTAL, and in
#   <3><3><h> : "┅" U2505 BOX DRAWINGS HEAVY TRIPLE DASH HORIZONTAL.
#
#   Diagonals are input by 1 for the slash slant, 2 for the backslash slant,
#   both 1 and 2 for a cross, and terminated by "d" for diagonal, as in
#   <1><d> : "╱" U2571 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT DIAGONAL UPPER RIGHT TO LOWER LEFT,
#   <1><2><d> : "╳" U2573 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT DIAGONAL CROSS.

#
#   The rationale for merging the BELT dead key with the BREVE dead key is
#   similarity in shape. But in practice, BELT cannot be merged with BREVE,
#   since we have a composed L with combining breve, used in Inng. As a result,
#   *dead_belt is merged with dead_belowbreve, i.e. dead_breve double press.
#
#   As an easier alternative, HORN could be used, but it is not, for the sake
#   of mnemonics, and to prevent HORN from becoming a holdall dead key.
#   See #*# HORN
#
#   BELT cannot be merged with HOOK either, because of "𝼑" U1DF11, nor with
#   CURL, because of "ȴ" U0234, nor with FLOURISH, because of "𝼦" U1DF26.
#
#   BELT cannot be merged with RETROFLEX_HOOK either because of "ɭ" U026D, nor
#   with PALATAL_HOOK because of "ᶅ" U1D85, and because RETROFLEX_HOOK and
#   PALATAL_HOOK occur together with BELT on "ꞎ" UA78E, "𐞝" U1079D, "𝼓" U1DF13.
#
#   BELT cannot be merged with RING either, because this occurs as middle ring
#   on small l: "ꬹ" UAB39.
#
#   The double diacritic "͜" U035C has emdash as a mnemonic base character, and
#   the question mark as an unconflicting ASCII alternative, for a consistent
#   input method across all dead keys featuring a double diacritic.
#
#   For a spacing clone of the combining breve below, "⏑" U23D1 METRICAL BREVE
#   could be picked. Yet it is a symbol, not a letter, so it is not a good fit.
#   Given that breve below and inverted breve below do not have spacing clones,
#   and for a consistent scheme across breve and inverted breve using modifier
#   letters only, not symbols nor punctuation, the top and bottom half o seem a
#   better fit. As these come in a baseline set and a superscript set, both are
#   provided, with the superscript going on the no-break thin space as a base.

#
#   In X11 XKB, the diacritic called “stroke” had an ambiguous shape, until the
#   horizontal stroke and the oblique stroke were disambiguated, by introducing
#   the new dead_longsolidusoverlay keysym named after U0338 "̸" COMBINING LONG
#   SOLIDUS OVERLAY as one of four extra dead elements for the German T3 layout
#   designed around 2010 and standardized in 2012 as DIN 2137:2012.
#   https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_2137#Neufassung_2012
#   https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/xorgproto/-/commit/6d4acb0e3a6568a8faaa651d4e3d32f917b9067b
#
#   The use of dead_stroke for horizontal, rather than for diagonal while
#   introducing *dead_bar to cover horizontal, appears to be fueled by the name
#   of the combining diacritic and the character names containing WITH STROKE
#   with the meaning of WITH BAR, or BARRED, like UAB33 LATIN SMALL LETTER
#   BARRED E, or in the Unicode 1.0 name of U0197 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH
#   STROKE, previously LATIN CAPITAL LETTER BARRED I.
#   See # # Bar and stroke diacritics
#
#   But since dead_longsolidusoverlay was removed in 2023, dead_stroke is used
#   for slash-shaped diacritics again, while missing *dead_bar gets a PUA code.

#
#   All barred letters occurring in orthographies have their precomposed form
#   encoded in Unicode, since the overlay bar diacritics do not render well.
#   https://www.frathwiki.com/Bar
#
#   The Chinantec tone marks "ꜗ" UA717, "ꜘ" UA718, "ꜙ" UA719, "ꜚ" UA71A are
#   consistently supported across four matching dead keys, with quotedbl and
#   EuroSign as base characters or with the no-break spaces as of "ꜚ" UA71A,
#   featured in lieu of a non-existing spacing clone of horn.

#
#   As a spacing counterpart of the short bar diacritic "̵" U0335, "˗" U02D7 is
#   convenient, since it is not the superscript minus sign, despite being named
#   a MODIFIER LETTER.

#   The eponymous letter of this virtual dead key is "Ⱡ" U2C60 LATIN CAPITAL
#   LETTER L WITH DOUBLE BAR, "ⱡ" U2C61 LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH DOUBLE BAR.
#
#   The short bar overlay in "Ꟈ" UA7C7 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH SHORT STROKE
#   OVERLAY is longer than the standard bar in "Đ" U0110 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D
#   WITH STROKE, and so makes a good point for support in this double press bar
#   virtual dead key.
#
#   "–" U2013 EN DASH is supported in this double bar dead key for sideways
#   compatibility with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, that has this multikey sequence for
#   it: <Multi_key><minus><minus><period>.

#
#   Budu uses MODIFIER LETTER SHORT EQUALS SIGN "꞊" UA78A as a tone letter, but
#   in this virtual dead key, UA78A is picked to fill the modifier letter slot
#   due to its “double” semantics. Additionally, UA78A matches its single press
#   counterpart "˗" U02D7 MODIFIER LETTER MINUS SIGN, while "˭" U02ED MODIFIER
#   LETTER UNASPIRATED is in *dead_flag.

#   This dead key is required to have an intuitive input method for "Ꝉ" UA748,
#   "ꝉ" UA749, that adds to "Ƚ" U023D, "ƚ" U019A on #dead_bar single press, and
#   "Ⱡ" U2C60, "ⱡ" U2C61 on *dead_bar double press.
#
#   "—" U2014 EM DASH could be supported in this high bar dead key to get the
#   closest possible to sideways compatibility with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, given
#   this has a multikey sequence for it: <Multi_key><minus><minus><minus>.
#   However, for consistency with the UCS, a sequence with a triple minus and
#   a final period is used for "―" U2015 HORIZONTAL BAR, since this may have a
#   length of three quarters of an em dash, being a four-per-three-em dash; and
#   a new multikey sequence made of a quadruple minus is added to support U2014
#   by multikey, although all of these three dashes are on live keys except for
#   "―" U2015 on regional variants.

#
#   As a diacritic, "͆" U0346 is picked for carrying semantics of horizontality
#   in a high position, but it ends here. The modifier letters are arrowheads,
#   with a rationale based on the laterality of the AltFr and AltGr modifiers
#   involved in typing "˂" U02C2 and "˃" U02C3. To complete the set, "˄" U02C4
#   and "˅" U02C5 are mapped to mnemonic, case insensitive letters "A" and "V".
#   Additionally, along the lines of what is done on dead_caron double press,
#   "C", "G", "W" can be used to input "˂" U02C2, and "D", "M", "P", "R" are
#   for "˃" U02C3.

#*# HORN
#   horn, descender, notch
#   dead_horn
#   Multi_key: ¦+
#   Dchar: "ơ" U01A1
#
#   As HORN has no reported usage outside Unicode precomposed letters, and the
#   precomposed letters with horn come in two pairs only, HORN is now extended
#   to support the historic letters with DESCENDER, as well as the Swedish "ⱸ"
#   U2C78 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH NOTCH. For mnemonics, both may be thought
#   of as letters with a low horn or a downwards horn.
#   https://www.frathwiki.com/Horn
#   https://www.frathwiki.com/Descender
#   https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%B1%B8
#
#   HORN could also be used as an easier alternative for the belt diacritic.
#   It is not, to prevent HORN from becoming an unmnemonic holdall.
#   See #^# BREVE_BELOW
#
#   Digits yield simple arrows as a redundant facility to meet most common user
#   expectations. Double arrows are yielded by *dead_flag.
#   See #*# FLAG
#
#   This also supports "᫉" U1AC9 COMBINING DOUBLE PLUS SIGN ABOVE and "᫊" U1ACA
#   COMBINING DOUBLE PLUS SIGN BELOW, while single counterparts are supported
#   in combining above for "᫈" U1AC8, combining below for "̟" U031F.
#   See #^# COMBINING_ABOVE
#   See #^# COMBINING_BELOW
#
#   Instead of a non-existing spacing clone of "̛" U031B, "ꜚ" UA71A is picked,
#   based on the horn’s shape, although this is a Chinantec tone mark, but a
#   spacing modifier letter anyway.
#
#   The other mnemonic spacing modifier letter, "˖" U02D6 MODIFIER LETTER PLUS
#   SIGN, based on the horn’s multikey equivalent, is supported by other base
#   letters: case insensitive P as the most mnemonic, but also by all other
#   fully available base letters for a streamlined user experience.
#
#   The Chinantec tone marks "ꜗ" UA717, "ꜘ" UA718, "ꜙ" UA719, "ꜚ" UA71A are
#   consistently supported across four matching dead keys, with quotedbl and
#   EuroSign as base characters or with the no-break spaces as of "ꜚ" UA71A,
#   featured in lieu of a non-existing spacing clone of horn.

#   Unlike superscript letters, used as abbreviation indicators in French and
#   other Latin-script-using languages, subscripts do not seem to be used in
#   orthographies of natural languages.
#
#   By lack of preformatted subscript uppercase, the uppercase slots are used
#   for small caps, frequent in phonetics, consistently with other dead key
#   implementations.
#
#   Letters still missing after a proposal advising to encode them all were for
#   now replaced with "∄" U2204 THERE DOES NOT EXIST.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02141-n2419-uralic-phonetic.pdf#page=5

#   But ultimately all these instances are populated with the remaining Greek
#   preformatted letters, both subscript and small caps:
#
#       "ᴦ" U1D26 # GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL GAMMA
#       "ᴧ" U1D27 # GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL LAMDA
#       "ᴨ" U1D28 # GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL PI
#       "ᴩ" U1D29 # GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL RHO
#       "ᴪ" U1D2A # GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL PSI
#       "ꭥ" UAB65 # GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL OMEGA — This did not fit in the
#            subscript empty slots, but it is both on regular V and intuitive O
#            in the SUBSCRIPT&GROUP_6 and GREEK&SUBSCRIPT virtual dead keys.
#       "ᵦ" U1D66 # GREEK SUBSCRIPT SMALL LETTER BETA
#       "ᵧ" U1D67 # GREEK SUBSCRIPT SMALL LETTER GAMMA
#       "ᵨ" U1D68 # GREEK SUBSCRIPT SMALL LETTER RHO

#   This started supporting "⃨" U20E8 COMBINING TRIPLE UNDERDOT when it was
#   moved in the wake of freeing up groups 1..3 of numbersign, with the
#   rationale that combining below is lower than the baseline ellipsis, on live
#   key except in ASCII mode, and that this character has other input methods,
#   too.
#   See #*# DOT_BELOW
#   See # # C01 numbersign
#
#   The associated diacritic and its spacing clone are built on the underscore
#   theme hinted by the subscript’s TeX command: "̲" U0332 and ASCII "_" U005F.

#   Since the combining hook above has no spacing clone nor any modifier letter
#   looking close to it, both half rings "ʾ" U02BE, "ʿ" U02BF are provided as a
#   workaround, with a rationale based on the laterality of the AltFr and AltGr
#   modifier keys involved in typing these left and right half rings this way.
#   AltGr + space yields nobreakspace, and the no-break thin space U202F is on
#   AltFr + space.

#   As the glottal letters new to Unicode v12 are diacriticized with a spiritus
#   lenis, Greek psili, they are here in a dedicated virtual dead key, based on
#   the hook above as looking closest. However, given the psili is considered a
#   comma above, and has been encoded consistently, these letters are also part
#   of the virtual dead key based on dead_belowcomma double press with a set of
#   duplicates in dead_belowcomma for convenience.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_breathing
#
#   As a diacritic, a mark looking close to a right half ring is picked, for an
#   alternative to the comma above: "҆" U0486, although this is Cyrillic. But a
#   dedicated spacing clone is available for Greek smooth breathing: "᾿" U1FBF.

#   Long leg is merged with macron thanks to empty intersection and

#   Small r with long leg has been obsoleted by IPA in 1989.
#
#   Ampersand as a base character supports the conjoining diacritic.
#
#   Cent and Cedi signs are supported by lack of C with macron, and
#   for consistency with en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#   The Chinantec tone marks "ꜗ" UA717, "ꜘ" UA718, "ꜙ" UA719, "ꜚ" UA71A are
#   consistently supported across four matching dead keys, with quotedbl and

#   Digits yield the full collection of simple, multiple, broken ("¦" U00A6)
#   vertical bars, for convenience, since the other input methods, in groups
#   or by multikey, may be less mnemonic or more complicated.

#
#   The conjoining variant of the combining diacritic is supported by ampersand
#   both in macron – "︦" UFE26 – and in macron below.
#
#   The double diacritic "͞" U035E has emdash as a mnemonic base character, and
#   the question mark as an unconflicting ASCII alternative, for a consistent
#   input method across all dead keys featuring a double diacritic.
#
#   Combining macron halves above – "︤" UFE24, "︥" UFE25 – are supported on all
#   unconflicting and fully available base letters for a streamlined user
#   experience.
#
#   Halves of combining diacritics are also supported in the virtual dead key
#   called “tilde and ampersand”.

#   Ampersand as a base character supports the conjoining diacritic "︭" UFE2D.
#
#   The double diacritic "͟" U035F has emdash as a mnemonic base character, and
#   the question mark as an unconflicting ASCII alternative, for a consistent
#   input method across all dead keys featuring a double diacritic.
#
#   Combining macron halves below – "︫" UFE2B, "︬" UFE2C – are supported on W
#   as well as on all other available base letters, consistently with
#   dead_macron single press, for a streamlined user experience.
#
#   This is redundant with the tilde and ampersand virtual dead key, that
#   supports halves of combining diacritics, too.

#   This is required for the letters used with a real line below, rather than a
#   macron below. But there are no precomposed letters with line below. Names
#   built on "WITH LINE BELOW" refer to a macron below instead.

#   The associated diacritic and its spacing equivalent are the same as for the
#   subscript dead key, here because of the diacritic, there due to the spacing
#   character, that is the plain ASCII underscore. Neither can be replaced with
#   a valid alternative. So, we have a pair of duplicates across two dead keys.

#*# STROKE
#   stroke, diagonal stroke, oblique stroke, bar (lenient)
#   dead_stroke
#   former dead_longsolidusoverlay
#   Multi_key: ¦/
#   Dchar: "ø" U00F8
#
#   Some letters occur both with a diagonal stroke and with an oblique stroke,
#   where the diagonal stroke has the steep slant of a regular slash, while the
#   oblique stroke is only slightly slanted, to such an extent that it might be
#   referred to as an oblique bar, if keeping things straightforward wasn’t the
#   best option. Yet prior to Unicode 16.0, the only letter occurring both with
#   a diagonal stroke and an oblique stroke was "K", where a diagonal stroke is
#   also short: "Ꝃ" UA742 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER K WITH DIAGONAL STROKE. But as
#   Unicode 16.0 adds "Ꟍ" UA7CC LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S WITH DIAGONAL STROKE
#   https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Latin_letter_S_with_diagonal_stroke.svg
#   alongside Unicode 6.0 "Ꞩ" UA7A8 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S WITH OBLIQUE STROKE,
#   the scheme is now clear, and double press is dedicated to oblique stroke.
#   However, empty slots in single press are populated conveniently for a
#   streamlined user experience.
#   See #^# OBLIQUE_STROKE
#
#   In X11 XKB, the diacritic called “stroke” had an ambiguous shape, until the
#   horizontal stroke and the slanted strokes were disambiguated by introducing
#   the new dead_longsolidusoverlay keysym named after U0338 "̸" COMBINING LONG
#   SOLIDUS OVERLAY as one of four extra dead elements for the German T3 layout
#   designed around 2010 and standardized in 2012 as DIN 2137:2012.

#
#   The use of dead_stroke for horizontal, rather than for diagonal while
#   introducing *dead_bar to cover horizontal, appears to be fueled by the name
#   of the combining diacritic and the character names containing "WITH STROKE"
#   with the meaning of WITH BAR, or BARRED, like UAB33 LATIN SMALL LETTER
#   BARRED E, or in the Unicode 1.0 name of U0197 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH
#   STROKE, previously LATIN CAPITAL LETTER BARRED I.
#   See # # Bar and stroke diacritics
#
#   But since dead_longsolidusoverlay was removed in 2023, dead_stroke is used
#   for slash-shaped diacritics again.

#
#   For convenience, to account for this confusion, letters without a variant
#   with stroke have their barred variant duplicated in this dead key as well,
#   to make it more lenient, for a streamlined user experience.
#
#   Digits yield mathematical slashes without space termination.

#
#   As a spacing counterpart of the long solidus diacritic "̸" U0338, the
#   division slash "∕" U2215 is picked rather than Chinantec "ꜘ" UA718, that
#   would be too unexpected and disrupting, with too far-fetched a rationale.
#   The Chinantec tone marks "ꜗ" UA717, "ꜘ" UA718, "ꜙ" UA719, "ꜚ" UA71A are
#   consistently supported across four matching dead keys, with quotedbl and
#   EuroSign as base characters or with the no-break spaces as of "ꜚ" UA71A,
#   featured in lieu of a non-existing spacing clone of horn.

#   The polygrams -êk-, -êl-, -êm-, -ên-, -êp-, -êq-, -êr-, -êt-, -êv-, -êch-
#   make dead_circumflex behave like an Ê key in most cases by using the fact
#   that the letters k, l, m, n, p, q, r, t, v, x do not exist as precomposed
#   letters with circumflex accent, and most of these are not in usage either
#   with combining circumflex as known composed letters. Those that are, will
#   need to be overridden, so as to prioritize the Ê key emulation sequences.

#   Cross-platform compatibility is full on MacOS, but only partial on Windows,
#   that is able to support only lowercase, and only digrams, provided that the
#   dead key is assigned the appropriate dead character: "ê" U00EA LATIN SMALL
#   LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX.
#
#   Likewise, a Ç key is emulated for use on the Canadian French variant.

#
#   The circumflex dead key is also expected to support superscript digits, for
#   the sake of conformance with NF Z71-300:2019, section 6.3.3 page 24, and as
#   a tribute to the German E DIN 2137-1:2020-11 that has been synced, but only
#   with the digits part, not the plus and minus signs and parentheses.

#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, that the “superscript digits by dead_circumflex”
#   feature comes from, the superscript dead key is missing, consistently with
#   keysymdef.h lacking a *dead_superscript or equivalent keysym.
#   See # # Notes on Unicode support
#   See # # Introducing new-school input composition
#
#   Anyway, the multikey equivalents of this way to input superscript digits
#   cannot be supported, since they conflict with "❤" U2764 as of "³" U00B3, or
#   with the new sequence <Multi_key><less><8> introduced for the less frequent
#   "♥" U2665, as of "⁸" U2078.
#   See # # Heart emoji
#
#   The diaeresis dead key offers an acceptable alternative input method for
#   superscript digits, with some mnemonic using the traditional French AZERTY
#   mapping of dead_diaeresis on the same key D11 as dead_circumflex, in shift
#   position.
#   See #*# DIAERESIS
#
#   Ultimately, the “superscript digits by dead_circumflex” feature may be
#   considered non-critical when a dedicated superscript dead key is present,
#   and superscript digits as well as small modifier letters (i.e. superscript
#   small letters) are on live keys for a streamlined user experience.
#   See #*# SUPERSCRIPT
#
#   So the set of remaining numeric base characters is used for other purposes.
#   One useful functionality is bullets, since the symbol groups are limited to
#   "•" U2022, "◦" U25E6, "‣" U2023, as well as "⁃" U2043, and "▪" U25AA. As a
#   complementary, partly intersecting set, dead_circumflex supports "▪" U25AA,
#   "▫" U25AB, "‣" U2023, "▹" U25B9, "➢" U27A2, "➣" U27A3, and also "•" U2022.

#
#   U017F LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S, in group 3 of s, has an additional input
#   method by <dead_circumflex><f> since French has no words including an -êf-
#   digram. Plus, <dead_circumflex><dollar> also yields this small letter.
#
#   Likewise, U2300 DIAMETER SIGN, in group 1 of (, is given yet another input
#   method by <dead_circumflex><d>, <dead_circumflex><D> thanks to French not

#
#   U016C LATIN CAPITAL LETTER U WITH BREVE is used in Esperanto and has thus a
#   shortcut by <dead_circumflex><B>, and U016D LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH BREVE
#   may alternatively be input by <dead_circumflex><b>. as French doesn’t have
#   any word with -êb-. Another pair of shortcuts uses Ugrave, since U has not
#   been encoded with circumflex and grave, as opposed to A, E and O.

#   dead_circumflex triple press
#   Multi_key: ¦<<<
#   Dchar: "ȟ" U021F
#
#   For ease of access, and in an attempt to meet potential user expectations,
#   the hacek dead key is also activatable by dead_circumflex triple press,
#   following the logic that multiple dead key presses shift diacritics around
#   and may also turn them. For portability, the full dead key content must be
#   supported, as well as multikey, even though this does not make sense.
#
#   The triple dead_circumflex sequences are not added right in the HACEK dead
#   key, because this file is also used as the source code for dead key tables.
#   See # # Notes about documentation

#
#   The hacek dead key supports subscript digits, for the sake of conformance
#   with NF Z71-300:2019, 6.3.3 p24, that E DIN 2137-1:2020-11 has been synced
#   with.
#   https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_2137#%C3%9Cberarbeitung_2020
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   However, this redundancy with the subscript dead key is not extended to the
#   signs and parentheses, as the standard does not require these, and because
#   their multikey equivalents would conflict with many mathematical symbols.
#   These would need to be disambiguated by leading space, screwing things up.
#
#   For ease of access, and in an attempt to meet potential user expectations,
#   the hacek dead key is also activatable by dead_circumflex triple press,
#   following the logic that multiple dead key presses shift diacritics around
#   and may also turn them. For portability, the full dead key content must be
#   supported, as well as multikey, even though this does not make sense.
#
#   While the most streamlined implementation would be by adding the triple
#   dead_circumflex sequences here, for consistency the content is copied and
#   maintained separately, since this file is also a documentation source.
#   See #^# HACEK input facility by CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   Another facility, <dead_grave><dead_acute>, would conflict with "‛" U201B.
#   The reverse would be counter-intuitive as well as pointless in the presence
#   of the triple circumflex alternative, using the most easily hit dead key of
#   AZERTY.

#   As of alphabetic dead key content, by lack of precomposed letters with a
#   hacek below, the full set of low arrowheads is mapped to mnemonic, case
#   insensitive base letters, rather than to the conflicting less and greater:
#   "A" for "˰" U02F0; "C", "G", "L", "W" for "˱" U02F1; "D", "M", "P", "R" for

#*# FLAG
#   flag partial, letter emoji, double, equal
#   *dead_flag UEFD7
#   Multi_key: ¦=
#   Dchar: "⚐" U2690
#
#   “FLAG” only serves the purpose of being a handy dead key identifier, while
#   the actual flags are output by the FLAG_EMOJI virtual dead key on double
#   press, supporting the full set of existing flag emoji.
#   See #^# FLAG_EMOJI
#
#   In XKB, on single press, letters yield regional indicator symbols with an
#   appended ZWNJ for letter emoji display and writing words.
#
#   Regional indicator symbols in isolation are supported on triple press.
#   See #^# REGIONAL_INDICATOR_SYMBOL
#
#   Digits yield double arrows as a redundant facility to meet most common user
#   expectations. Single arrows are yielded by dead_horn.
#   See #*# HORN
#
#   Symbols other than "⹀" U2E40 DOUBLE HYPHEN cannot be supported in group 0,
#   due to numerous multikey conflicts. (With respect to this, mathematical
#   symbols use <Multi_key><minus><equal>.)
#
#
#   Cross-platform compatibility
#
#   Windows supports an extra modifier added on Caps Lock for continuous input,
#   and also for composing flags. As in continuous input, ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
#   should be appended, on Windows Shift would need to be held down for writing
#   words consistently with the uppercase display of letter emoji, but not when
#   inputting flags.
#
#   MacOS supports an iterative dead key for continuous input, on triple press.
#   As XKB has no support for iterative dead keys, the behavior of single press
#   and triple press is swapped, so that single press outputs an appended ZWNJ,
#   and triple press outputs regional indicator symbol letters in isolation.
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, sequences starting with ¦= conflict with currency
#   symbols and with double acute, given that en_US.UTF-8/Compose uses ¦", not
#   ¦:, for diaeresis, and so cannot use ¦" for <dead_doubleacute>, so it uses
#   ¦= instead. Removing currency symbol sequences starting with EQUALS SIGN,
#   leaving only those ending with EQUALS SIGN, solves this issue.
#   See # # Currency symbols
#
#
#   Auxiliary characters
#
#   Auxiliary characters are supported with base characters in synergy:
#   The multikey equivalents are impractical, but full ASCII equivalents
#   would conflict with mathematical symbols.
#
#   *  ZWNJ is used to prevent an ISO code letter pair from being displayed
#      as a flag;
#   *  WJ is used to prevent an RI character from breaking off a character of
#      another class;
#   *  Supporting the high surrogate is designed for portability, but on Linux
#      and ChromeOS it is ineffective.
#
#   As a diacritic, we have "͇" U0347 COMBINING EQUALS SIGN BELOW, as there is
#   no variant above, and as a flipped yet spacing counterpart there is the
#   "˭" U02ED MODIFIER LETTER UNASPIRATED, while "꞊" UA78A MODIFIER LETTER
#   SHORT EQUALS SIGN is consistently in *dead_bar double press.
#   See #^# DOUBLE_BAR

#
#   Flags are supported on double press followed by the ISO country code.
#   This list is up-to-date as of Unicode v15.0.
#   Full list of the main country flags:
#   https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html
#
#   As a combining diacritic, by lack of a combining equals sign above, a close
#   relative, "͌" U034C COMBINING ALMOST EQUAL TO ABOVE, fills in the slot.
#   This happens to match the waving flags, that non-country / non-subdivision
#   flags are typically pictured as, for iconicity.
#
#   The sequences with no-break space and no-break thin space, used for spacing
#   clones of diacritics or for modifier letters on most dead keys, output a
#   black flag by no-break space, and a white flag by no-break thin space,
#   since the flag used as a base character for subdivision flags, "🏴" U1F3F4
#   WAVING BLACK FLAG, is in the SMP, cross-platform incompatible.
#
#   However, U1F3F4 WAVING BLACK FLAG is output by backslash.

#   yields reversed high, opening curly quotation marks U201B, U201F.

#   "̖" U0316 COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT BELOW is supported by ampersand, and its
#   spacing counterpart "ˎ" U02CE MODIFIER LETTER LOW GRAVE ACCENT is supported
#   by underscore, because double press is the double grave accent. Else double
#   press followed by space or no-break space is the most straightforward input
#   method for the variants below. But there are no precomposed letters with a
#   grave accent below. Therefore, a virtual dead key is not required.

#   Digits yield numbers 1 through 10 (i.e. digits 1..9 and number 10) followed
#   by a period, as an experimental convenience, while parenthesized digits and
#   letters are not supported. Numbers 11..20 are in dead_belowcomma.

#   "⃨" U20E8 COMBINING TRIPLE UNDERDOT is also supported, by underscore, since
#   this diacritic needed to be moved in the wake of freeing up groups 1..3 of
#   numbersign, with the rationale that it is a variant of underdot, and that
#   the option dead_belowdot double press followed by period is less intuitive
#   and far more impractical.

#   Multi_key: ¦:
#   Dchar: "ë" U00EB
#
#   Followed by quotedbl, apostrophe or rightsinglequotemark, dead_diaeresis
#   yields low, opening, curly quotation marks U201A, U201E.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   Diaeresis also supports long dashes, with base characters on the upper row,
#   level 2, key E11 (degree sign) or key E12 (plus), which makes sense as on
#   base layouts, dead_diaeresis is on E12 level 1. Other facilities are
#   available in groups and in a dedicated multikey scheme.
#   See # # Dashes and hyphens
#   See # # Long dashes
#
#   For intuitivity, with asterisk as a base character, dead_diaeresis yields
#   "⁑" U2051, consistently with dead_circumflex for "⁂" U2042 ASTERISM.
#
#   Two less expected yet heavily used symbols, "‖" U2016 DOUBLE VERTICAL LINE
#   and "¦" U00A6 BROKEN BAR repurposed as multikey symbol, have quick access
#   by dead_diaeresis followed by slash, or backslash respectively (not bar,
#   due to conflicts with the diaeresis and macron virtual dead keys).
#   See # # DIAERESIS&MACRON
#   See # # MACRON&DIAERESIS
#   See # # Symbols for multikey and composition
#
#   "¦" U00A6 is also in group 12 of |.
#   See # # C10 bar
#
#   Superscript digits, formerly in dead_circumflex, are also supported for the
#   sake of NF Z71-300:2019. However, this redundancy with the superscript dead
#   key is not extended to the signs and parentheses since NF Z71-300:2019 does
#   not require these, and their multikey equivalents would conflict with many
#   mathematical symbols. that would need to be disambiguated by leading space.
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   With diacriticized base letters, dead_diaeresis yields "Ǜ" U01DB, "ǜ" U01DC
#   but also "Ø" U00D8, "ø" U00F8 for convenience.
#   See # # Oslash for Danish, Norwegian and other languages
#
#   Supporting the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols high surrogate is designed
#   for portability, but on Linux and ChromeOS, this is ineffective.

#   The glottal letters new to Unicode v12 are duplicated here for convenience.
#
#   Digits yield numbers 11 through 20 followed by a period, as an experimental
#   convenience, while parenthesized digits and letters are not supported.
#   Numbers 1..10 followed by a period are in dead_cedilla.
#   See #*# CEDILLA
#
#   For convenience, the multikey sequence ¦§ is also supported to account for
#   the mapping of the section sign on level 3 of B10 in French mode for the
#   synergy with digits and keyboard backcompat.

#   This yields mainly the glottal letters new to Unicode v12, since these may
#   be expected here, because the spiritus lenis that these glottal letters are
#   diacriticized with, often happens to be shaped like a comma above, that may
#   also be referred to as a curly apostrophe on top, so that "̓" U0313
#   COMBINING COMMA ABOVE is the actual encoding of the combining psili.
#
#   Nevertheless, the glottal letters are also in a dedicated dead key,

### Group dead key introduction
#
#   The group dead key is a special dead key designed to remap every single key
#   position. E.g. group 1 of Ɔɔ, Ññ and non-breaking hyphen outputs "―" U2015,
#   a feature designed for African, Breton, and remapped variants.
#   See #*# GROUP_1
#
#   Usually, however, the scope of the group dead key is limited to a handy set
#   of characters including the Latin base alphabet, the ten digits and the set
#   of ASCII symbols mapped on level 3 as of 30 symbols, and level 1 for period
#   and comma, plus the space bar, with ordinary space and no-break space used.
#
#   The resulting letter groups and symbol groups make up the main content of a
#   standard group dead key as used on this keyboard layout, with support for a
#   minimum number of 4 multiple presses. Support for looping through the group
#   array is straightforward on macOS with the terminator showing the currently
#   active group, and on Windows. In XCompose, supporting the first four groups
#   by multiple presses is feasible, and going beyond is not even desirable, as
#   all groups — except group 1 and group 2 — are activatable by typing a digit
#   after pressing the group dead key. This scheme expands the group array to a
#   total number of 12 groups accessed using the group dead key, piling up upon
#   the default group, that is obiously numbered 0, contrasting with the scheme
#   introduced by ISO/IEC 9995.
#
#   Digits and non-ASCII base characters:
#   See #*# GROUP_1
#   and following, up to #^# GROUP_12
#
#   ASCII symbols and punctuation, space, no-break space:
#   See ### Space and symbol groups
#
#   Latin base alphabet:
#   See ### Letter groups
#
#   The keysym *dead_group is not supported in keysymdef.h. For the time being,
#   the private use character UEFB0 is used as the group dead key.
#
#
# # History
#
#   The group dead key has been introduced by Karl Pentzlin during the
#   implementation of the new DIN 2137-2:2012 standard on Windows. Noticing the
#   lack of support for the ISO/IEC 9995 style group dead key in TSF, the Text
#   Services Framework on Windows, Karl Pentzlin moved the group dead key to a
#   real dead key taking over the dead key behavior that ISO/IEC 9995 specified
#   on the level 2 + level 3 modifier combination. A similar dead key included
#   in other keyboard layouts may be called “Latin and punctuation” as on the
#   French ergonomic bépo keyboard layout, or “Europe” as in NF Z71-300:2019.
#   https://bepo.fr/wiki/Latin_et_ponctuation
#
#   XKB supports the ISO/IEC 9995 conformant group selection since 2013, see
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60991
#
#   But XKB keysym mapping is limited to a maximum number of 8 elements. This
#   array is used up by the extra graphic modifier required for the support of
#   input methods for the Unicode conformant digital representation of numbers
#   and measurement units used in 50+ countries, conforming to the guidelines
#   set up by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures BIPM, and for input
#   of French, that uses U202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE to space out a number of
#   punctuation marks following the French Imprimerie Nationale and/or French
#   new-school typesetting as documented in points (2) and (3) of:
#   https://forums.macg.co/threads/typo-caracteres-capitales-accentues.25739/page-5#post-3151119
#
#   Virtual dead keys accessed by multiple dead key presses in turn have been
#   introduced by the bépo development team in 2015, while upgrading the bépo
#   layout to version 1.1 for the NF Z71-300:2019 keyboard layout standard.
#
#
# # Numbering
#
#   For UX consistency, the default group is group 0. Therefore, the numbering
#   scheme specified in ISO/IEC 9995 is ruled out in favor of a zero-based one.
#   Only groups accessed by the group dead key are numbered starting
#   with 1, because a group accessed by an n-uple press on the group dead key
#   must be called “group n” rather than “group n+1”. The ISO/IEC 9995 standard
#   uses 1-based numbering because it uses the terms “primary” and “secondary”
#   with respect to groups and fails to consider dead key based group selection
#   with support for multiple presses.
#
#   As a short identifier for "group #", "g#" is proposed.
#
#
# # Cross-platform compatibility
#
#   Implementing the group selector as a dead key rather than a modifier key
#   avoids breaking user experience across platforms, since Windows unsupports
#   the ISO group selector modifier key combination Shift + AltGr, but supports
#   6 + 1 modifiers, and Apple has broken its technote TN2056 around 2015 after
#   previously allowing to use left Option as an extra modifier, that was
#   effectively used by the German Neo ergonomic keyboard layout. After the
#   dedicated left Option was broken, Neo emulated left Option using
#   Takayama Fumihiko’s Karabiner Elements.

# # Maintenance
#
#   Filling empty slots with null output "" U0000 can be avoided. The "" U0000
#   strings have been removed for ease of maintenance on 2023-01-13T1356+0100.
#   See # # Notes for maintenance
#
#
#
### Space and symbol groups
#
#   The base characters in this section are mapped on AltGr/Option or unshifted
#   keys as of comma, period and space. Symbols and punctuation mapped on level
#   three assume using the group dead key in synergy on AltGr/Option.
#
#   Consistently this section is ordered by keys rather than by code points, as
#   the order of the ASCII symbols on the keyboard layout is used for mnemonics
#   in synergy with the learning curve required by using the base alphabet as a
#   means to remember the symbols, not meant to be printed on physical keycaps.
#
#
# # Math symbols in symbol groups
#
#   Mathematical symbols outside the math section, i.e. in the dead key section
#   and especially in the symbol groups, are labeled as "math" since this label
#   is converted into link text, with a hyperlink to the first instance of that
#   symbol on the math symbols page, on the condition that the "math" string is
#   appended as the very last element.
#
#   Non-math characters, such as the letter pi and the envelope emoji, are also
#   given this "math" label, as far as a multikey sequence in the math section
#   is available for input. This "math" label is therefore more of a UX feature
#   than of an information about the `Math` status. In this regard, this "math"
#   label is the opposite of the `Sm` General Category, discussed at the start
#   of the math section.
#   See ### Mathematical symbols by multikey
#
#
# # Emoji in symbol groups
#
#   Supporting all emoji in the Basic Multilingual Plane except Chinese letter
#   emoji makes sense because input by dead keys is cross-platform compatible,
#   whereas SMP emoji are excluded from this scheme because of cross-platform
#   incompatibilities due to design mistakes in Windows, where keyboard layouts
#   have been coded by a single developer whose errors persistently degraded
#   the usability of most of the world’s computers.
#
#   A number of BMP emoji are supported alternatively or only elsewhere:
#
#       * See #^# Abbreviations, Units and Legal Symbols
#       * See #^# Western Zodiacal Signs
#       * See #^# Emoji by multikey
#       * See # # Arrow emoji
#
#   A number of Supplemental Multilingual Plane emoji are mapped on live keys.
#
#   The two emoji-related variation selectors are in group 10 on key E, D03,
#   for emoji style, VS16 UFE0F, and on key T, D05, for text style, VS15 UFE0E.
#
#   The five emoji skin tone modifiers based on the 6-shades Fitzpatrick scale
#   "🏻" U1F3FB, "🏼" U1F3FC, "🏽" U1F3FD, "🏾" U1F3FE, "🏿" U1F3FF are discontinued
#   as inappropriate on a general-purpose keyboard layout without extensive
#   emoji support.

#
#   The "ª" U00AA FEMININE ORDINAL INDICATOR is a legacy character, superseded
#   by the use of preformatted superscript small letters for ordinal indicators
#   in French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, also supporting plural forms.
#   The legacy ordinal indicators are supported by multikey and in group 12.
#   See #^# Legacy ordinal indicators
#   See # # D09 braceright
#
#   In Unicode CLDR, "‌" U200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER is the cursive non-joiner.
#   Consistently, "‍" U200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER is the cursive joiner.
#   The new names are intended to improve familiarity, as opposed to the legacy
#   names based on “ZERO WIDTH”.

#
#   Since quotedbl is mapped on the E key in order to be replaced with EuroSign
#   for compliance with the related recommendation from the European Commission
#   to map € on AltGr + E, EuroSign works as a base character as well.
#   See dispocla.cpp // ## Note about EURO SIGN

#   The positions in groups 1 through 3 could be used for single, double and
#   triple daggers for the sake of mnemonics, but they are not, as daggers are
#   more extensively supported together with their left/right guard or turned
#   counterparts in tilde followed by digits 1 through 6,
#   See #*# TILDE
#
#   Another reason is that these three tilde-based operators are useful, unlike
#   "∼" U223C TILDE OPERATOR that was disunified from ASCII tilde while Unicode
#   is unable to provide any rationale for this disunification.
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/UnicodeStandard-15.0.pdf#page=903&zoom=100,0,500
#
#   Consistently, both U223C and U007E display exactly the same, and semantics
#   are also unambiguous. As a result, U223C is not supported in group 1 of ~.

# # D06 at, dead_greek
#
#   Since v1.7.0, dead_greek is also mapped on level 3 instead of the at sign,
#   that is supported on base level E11, making its level 3 D06 alias redundant
#   so that this position is available for an easier dead_greek duplicate. As a
#   consequence, dead_greek must work as an alias base character for the symbol
#   groups.
#
#   "◌" U25CC is in group 1 as the usual pick for the dotted circle, a generic
#   base character for combining diacritics.

#   The first three positions are inaccessible by multikey equivalents, due to
#   an inavoidable interference of numbersign with itself. As a consequence,
#   for cross-platform compatibility, these positions cannot be used. Only the

#   The black or white square emoji, coming in four sizes as U25AA, U25AB,
#   U25FB, U25FC, U25FD, U25FE, U2B1B, U2B1C, are dispatched by color in two
#   sets. These also have multikey alternatives. "▪" U25AA is considered a
#   Unicode equivalent of CSS `list-style-type: square`, but it is emoji #1622
#   and is therefore subject to rendering issues when used as a bullet.

#   Unlike the open box "␣" U2423, denoting an ASCII space U0020, and also more
#   generally a breaking space as a category, the shouldered open box "⍽" U237D
#   used for a Latin-1 no-break space U00A0, and sometimes also generically for
#   any no-break space, notably the no-break thin space U202F, is uncommon.

#   The arrows in groups 1 and 2 have alphabetic mnemonic in French, where
#   an “arrow” is a “flèche”. This is consistent with DIN 2137 since the 2023
#   revision switched arrows on U and P keys for the right-pointing to be on
#   “P wie Pfeil”, “arrow” in German.

#   The undertie "‿" U203F is supported in group 12 for its use in phonetics to
#   denote linking, aka liaison, instead of former "❩" U2769, that was intended
#   to prevent misuse of "☽" U263D, but is nearly unused in practice.

# # C05 minus
#
#   Unlike U2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN, in group 1 of equal, U2010 HYPHEN is not
#   in group 1 of minus, because it is a duplicate of U002D HYPHEN-MINUS.
#   See # # B05 equal
#   See # # Dashes and hyphens
#
#   Instead, U2212 MINUS SIGN is mapped here with respect to incomplete layouts
#   lacking arithmetic base operators, usually on level 5 live key positions.
#
#   For completeness, U2010 HYPHEN is in group 12 of minus, where it should not
#   do too much harm.

# # C07 underscore

#   "―" U2015 HORIZONTAL BAR is supported in group 1 with other base characters
#   for regional variants that cannot support this character on live key.
#   See # # HORIZONTAL BAR for African, Breton and Polynesian variants
#
#   Thanks to not needing to support U2015 in group 1 of underscore, the first
#   three groups are available for bullets. While "•" U2022 and "◦" U25E6 are
#   consistent with mainstream practice, the pick for level 3 is "‣" U2023,
#   consistently with Unicode scalars, the group number and the level number,
#   rather than "▪" U25AA, that is an emoji and as such is supported in group 5
#   of numbersign as part of a set of four.

#   With respect to mathematical symbols that need to be negated, the positions
#   in groups 11 and 12 are used for "∣" U2223 DIVIDES, negated as "∤" U2224, and
#   "∥" U2225 PARALLEL TO, negated as "∦" U2226. As of "‖" U2016 DOUBLE VERTICAL
#   LINE, it is in the same group of colon, preventing a potential accessibility
#   bias fostering misuse of "∥" U2225 as "‖" U2016.

#
#   The empty and filled checkboxes are supported here with slight mnemonics of
#   "|" and nearby "]", because the same groups of "#" are unusable. The light
#   variant "⮽" U2BBD cannot, but it remains in its place in group 10 of "#".
#   See # # C01 numbersign
#
#   What these positions are not used for is single, double and triple daggers,
#   more extensively supported together with their left/right guard or turned
#   counterparts in tilde followed by digits 1 through 6.

#   Frequency requires the two hearts to be in the topmost groups, with U2764
#   HEAVY BLACK HEART (red heart) in group 1 for being the most-used emoji in
#   France, U2665 BLACK HEART SUIT emoji in group 2 as the 14th-ranking emoji,
#   and the other suits U2663, U2666 and U2660 in groups 3 through 5.
#
#   This order disrupts the traditional English alphabetical order. Getting
#   some mnemonics into the resulting list requires to assign CLUB to group 3,
#   DIAMOND to group 4, and SPADE, highest-ranking, to group 5 accordingly.
#
#   The outlined counterparts "♡" U2661, "♧" U2667, "♢" U2662, "♤" U2664 do not
#   have the emoji status; they are supported in the same order, with the same
#   base character, in groups 2 through 5 of dead_circumflex.

#
#   "¦" U00A6 BROKEN BAR repurposed as multikey symbol is in group 11, where
#   the “double” mnemonic is carried by the colon base character, while the
#   “single” mnemonic is in the group number, as opposed to group 12 used for
#   "‖" U2016 DOUBLE VERTICAL LINE, consistently with "∥" U2225 in the same
#   group of bar.
#   See # # C10 bar
#
#   For an easier input method with respect to its potential high frequency,
#   "¦" U00A6 is also in dead_diaeresis followed by backslash.

#   The (full) triangular colon is about 40 times more frequent than its half.
#   Consistently, "ː" U02D0 is in group 1, "ˑ" U02D1 in group 2. For mnemonics,
#   rather than the number of triangles, the 1/1 vs 1/2 logic is convenient.

#   "⁛" U205B FOUR DOT MARK is a highlighter mark used by scribes in the margin
#   and is annotated as such in the Unicode Code Charts.
#
#   "⟰" U27F0 is repurposed as the level 5 modifier symbol, with the rationale
#   that this key increments by 4 the level index. Called AltFr on this layout
#   and natively supported by XKB and the Windows TSF, this modifier is easily
#   emulated on macOS. Japanese keyboards have left and right Oyayubi keys that
#   made it into the Windows layout driver source code by Ian James as LOYA and
#   ROYA, but not into ISO/IEC 9995.

#   U200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE has an alternate, more intuitive and more familiar
#   acronym: WNJ, for WORD NON-JOINER.

#
#   U200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE also has an intuitive, to-the-point French name:
#   CÉSURE CONDITIONNELLE, break opportunity, non-existent in English.
#
#   The WNJ is also on live key, level 4 of the space bar, for its use in long
#   URLs expected to line-wrap after slashes but not doing so in browsers that
#   are not fully Unicode conformant, and because level 4 of the space bar must
#   not be used for frequent space characters like U00A0 NBSP and U202F NBTSP.

#
#   U2002 and U2003 are on level 1 for usability, although these spaces were
#   originally intended to be no-break. That brings the need to move their two
#   breaking clones to level3, since these have become canonically equivalent.
#   U2002..U2006 and U2008..U200A were originally intended to be no-break, just
#   like U2007 FIGURE SPACE ultimately remained, as sort of the sole survivor.
#
#   Unlike stated in UAX #14, U2007 is not intended for use *in* figures,
#   but *before* figures for indentation in tables. Therefore, it is also
#   called tabular digit space, as opposed to the tabular punctuation space
#   U2008.

#
#   U205F MEDIUM MATHEMATICAL SPACE is a breaking 4/18 em, or 4½-per-em.
#
#   U3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE does not hang into the margin.

#
#   Except U2000 and U2001, originally intended to be breaking, these space
#   characters could be followed by WORD JOINER so as to convert them to
#   no-break spaces consistent with the original design. But they are not,
#   for cross-platform compatibility and with respect to U2000 and U2001.

### Letter groups
#
#   These groups contain mainly letters and mathematical letter symbols, but
#   some groups also contain mathematical digit symbols.
#
#   In this section, group headings are prefixed with `#+# `.
#
#   On the alphabet, the groups yield mainly:
#
#   Group  0  (g0): live keys (default, no group selected);
#   Group  1  (g1): group pressed once: Latin;
#   Group  2  (g2): group pressed twice: Latin;
#   Group  3  (g3): group pressed thrice or followed by digit 3: Latin;
#   Group  4  (g4): group pressed 4 times or followed by digit 4: Latin;
#   Group  5  (g5): group then digit 5: Latin;
#   Group  6  (g6): group then digit 6: Greek and Greek math symbols;
#   Group  7  (g7): group then digit 7: Latin script style math symbols;
#   Group  8  (g8): group then digit 8: Latin double-struck/bold/italic math symbols;
#   Group  9  (g9): group then digit 9: Latin fraktur/monospace math symbols;
#   Group 10 (g10): group then digit 0: Latin sans-serif math symbols;
#   Group 11 (g11): group then digit 1: Latin;
#   Group 12 (g12): group then digit 2: Latin.

#+# GROUP_6
#   Group 6 on the base alphabet: Greek letters
#
#   This group, using the mnemonic of the Greek dead key in column 6, letter Y
#   or Greek i (i grec in French), is an alternative Greek letter input method.
#   It may be used where the Greek letter dead key is missing and so, polytonic
#   Greek and the circled dead key are not supported.
