#   * In Unicode CLDR, this platform is labeled ChromeOS, and it is explained that
#     in the CLDR, *Linux* is supported alongside *ChromeOS*, or through ChromeOS.
#
#               Installation: 1. Set the input method to XIM, because other input methods may
#                                not support multi-character output, including composed letters
#                                required for Unicode conformant output on dead keys; and with
#                                the input method set to none, this Compose is not compiled.
#
#                                The following command activates the X Window Input Method:
#                                    im-config -n xim
#
#                                The currently active input method displays on line 2 after:
#                                    im-config -m
#
#                                Setting the input method to XIM to begin with is essential,
#                                because distros may not ship XIM as the default.
#
#                             2. Make sure to be using the full-length file `Compose.yml`.
#
#                             3. Proceed following method A, B, or C:
#
#                                A. Most backward compatible:
#                                   1. Back up the file /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#                                   2. Append `Compose.yml` to /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#
#                                      Prepending rather than appending breaks U1E7A and U1E7B
#                                      overriding U01D5 and U01D6, and "V́" and "v́" overriding
#                                      U01D7 and U01D8 as defined in en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#                                B. Shared computer with User Compose:
#                                   1. Back up the file ~/.XCompose.
#                                   2. Append `Compose.yml` to ~/.XCompose.
#
#                                C. Shared computer without User Compose:
#                                   1. Copy `Compose.yml` to ~/.XCompose.
#                                   2. Optionally uncomment the following line:
#
#                                       include "%L"
#
#                                   Required for using non-Latin keyboard layouts
#                                   supported by en_US.UTF-8/Compose, default for fr_FR.
#
#                             The changes take effect in any application after reopening it, or
#                             after opening a new session if the input method needs to be changed.
#
#             Uninstallation: A, B: Restore the previously backed-up original Compose file.
#                             C:    Delete this Compose file.

### Output strings for live keys
#
#   XCompose [unlike the Windows TSF] is able to output more than one single
#   code unit by dead keys.
#
#   XCompose also handles the output of strings after a single live key press.
#   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ComposeKey#Compose_key
#   https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/man5/Compose.5.html
#   https://wiki.debian.org/XCompose
#
#   This feature requires the X Window Input Method.
#   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xkeyboard-config/+bug/1584314/comments/6
#   http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man8/im-config.8.html
#   https://askubuntu.com/questions/129680/how-can-i-make-ibus-not-ignore-xcompose
#
#   In XCompose, a single keysym hapax is processed for direct output, whereas a keysym
#   followed by another keysym in >0 instances is considered a dead key throughout, and
#   its singleton output is discarded, thus the system “eats” the dead key press if the
#   input sequence is undefined.
#
#   Definition format in XCompose files:
#   * Single character output may be defined like in allocation tables,
#     but this format is reportedly not interoperable across XKB.
#   * Strings must be defined as literals delimited by double quotes.
#     This is the interoperable format for single character output.
#   Both formats may be used concurrently.
#
#   Definition format in allocation tables (Symbols directory):
#   Single character output in any UCS plane may be defined in several formats:
#   * Uxxxx[x[x]] hexadecimal
#   * U00xxxxxx hexadecimal
#   * 0x01xxxxxx hexadecimal
#   The specified format "\0x123A" does *not* work, neither with nor without quotes
#   or leading backslash.
#   https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.html
#
#   These layouts make extensive use of added keysyms as in keysymdef.h:97.

#
#   Line comments are mandatory for compatibility with defective compilers that

# # Breton polygraphs
#
#   The Breton polygraphs are mapped as such on the CʼHWERTY keyboard following
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19506.
#
#   Following the link chain from the documentation of the CʼHWERTY keyboard:
#   http://www.drouizig.org/index.php/br/binviou-br/klavier-c-hwerty-ha-sturiou/162-faq-foire-aux-questions
#   https://dominiko.livejournal.com/22848.html
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25349
#
#   The Breton trigraph has a dedicated key on the Breton variant "kbbrFRs" and
#   it is supported on Shift + AltFr + A on the French base layout "kbfrFRs".
#
#   The Breton trigraph uses regular letter apostrophe U02BC.
#   See Breton exemplar characters in CLDR as pointed in:
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19506#c16.
#   CLDR versions below v34 are too incomplete:
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/release-34/common/main/br.xml#L1164
#
#   These have got mnemonic keysyms in keysymdef.h but may not be supported yet,
#   so they are defined here using "ʼ" U02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE:
#
<c_h> : "cʼh" # See # # Notes about syntax
<C_h> : "Cʼh" #
<C_H> : "CʼH" #
#
#
#   The Breton digraph is mapped on the CʼHWERTY keyboard.
#   Therefore, in XKB, it has got three keysyms, too.
#
#   Unlike the trigraph, the digraph has no dedicated support on any variant.
#   It is expected to be input like all polygraphs, as used in many languages.

# # Automated punctuation spacing for fr-FR, regular with NNBSP U202F
#
#   Imprimerie nationale (France) assumes that big punctuation is spaced out using either
#   of these spaces:
#
#       * No-break justifying space, behaving like Unicode’s NBSP U00A0;
#       * No-break thin space, behaving like Unicode’s NNBSP U202F.
#
#   Functionally, NNBSP is a no-break clone of Unicode’s thin space THSP U2009.
#
#   The preferred name and abbreviation of U2009 are NARROW SPACE, NSP.
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/tools/cldr-code/src/main/java/org/unicode/cldr/util/CodePointEscaper.java
#
#   This is regular typesetting at Imprimerie nationale except for colon and quotation marks,
#   although the latter are typeset with NNBSP in the Imprimerie nationale style guide
#   (_Lexique des règles en usage à l’Imprimerie nationale_, Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 2002);
#   only the verbatim rule on page 149 disagrees.
#   In mainstream high-quality publishing (new school), NNBSP is used throughout.
#
#   See Philippe Verdy’s testimony:
#   http://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2015-m06/0220.html
#
#   Unicode was supposed to encode SI/BIPM number typesetting as well as French
#   punctuation typesetting, and for that purpose encoded THIN SPACE along with
#   other typographic space characters in the range U+2000..U+200A. Accordingly
#   the line breaking property was set to no-break for all spaces starting with
#   U+2002, after the two widest spaces in a breaking variant U+2000, U+2001 vs
#   U+2002, U+2003.
#
#   But that design goal was ultimately compromised. To cover up the vandalism,
#   U+2007 FIGURE SPACE was left no-break with the hypocritical allegation that
#   this space is used “in” numbers, while it was encoded as the tabular space,
#   to be used before numbers when typesetting tables the old way, alongside an
#   equivalent indenting by the width of a decimal dot or comma: U+2008.

#   The corrected Unicode position is found in UAX #14 since 2007, in TUS since
#   2014: The Unicode Standard, version 7.0.0, 2014, p. 265, section 6.2,
#   heading “Space Characters”, subheading “Narrow No-Break Space”.
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/ch06.pdf#G1834
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/ch06.pdf#page=13&zoom=100,0,300
#
#      The NNBSP can be used to represent the narrow space occurring around punctuation
#      characters in French typography, which is called an “espace fine insécable.”
#
#   Unicode® Standard Annex #14, Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm, Unicode 15.1.0:
#   https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-51.html#NNBSPdoc
#
#      When NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE occurs in French text, it should be
#      interpreted as an “espace fine insécable”.
#
#   The Unicode position reflects also in a Script Ad Hoc Group (since 2024-03:
#   Script Encoding Working Group) recommendation made on 2019-07-22 for the
#   Unicode Technical Committee meeting #160.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/topical/scriptadhoc/
#   Recommendations to UTC #160 July 2019 on Script Proposals — Script Ad Hoc group
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19286-script-recs.pdf#page=14
#
#      The Unicode Standard includes several different space characters.
#      It is acceptable to use THIN SPACE, and then use a higher-level protocol,
#      a word joiner, or tailored line-breaking to prevent line-breaking.
#      Alternatively, NNBSP can be used to force no-break behavior.
#
#   However, higher level protocols and tailoring are inacceptable options when
#   considered for the purpose of digitally representing natural languages, the
#   more as the Unicode Standard specifies that it encodes plain text.
#   https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/UnicodeStandard-15.0.pdf#page=45
#
#   In Unicode CLDR, French migrated from NBSP to NNBSP for grouping digits and
#   in short measurement unit patterns, in v34, released on 2018-10-15:
#   https://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-34
#
#      The French locale now uses narrow no-break space U+202F in several
#      places: as the numeric grouping separator, in many short unit patterns,
#      and in the locale display name patterns. It also changed normal space to
#      no-break space U+00A0 in the wide unit patterns.
#
#      Migration
#
#      French grouping separator changed from no-break space U+00A0 to
#      narrow no-break space U+202F.
#
#   As of punctuation spacing automation while writing, there is a feedback
#   issue submitted while commenting an LDML extension designed for SIL/Keyman:
#   “PRI #367: Automated punctuation spacing”

# # Justifying no-break spaces
#
#   NO-BREAK SPACE U00A0 is abusively and unchangeably tailored as fixed-width
#   in word processors other than Microsoft Word 2013, raising issues in Polish
#   as well as in Russian and other locales requiring no-break space between
#   words, and thus requiring the no-break space to be justifying as defined.

### Multi_key sequences
#
#   The described behavior of XCompose is based on en_US.UTF-8/Compose,
#   as it is used in France.
#
#   The maximum number of keysyms is nine. Longer sequences are ignored.
#
#
# # Notes for maintenance
#
#   The colon alignment in column 100 is based on longest Multi_key sequences
#   in terms of string length, as used for U10789, U107AB.
#
#   The Multi_key equivalent is added below each dead key sequence by a script
#   called `generate-multikey.pl`, run by `multikey.sh`, if the sequence is
#   marked up accordingly. For portability, Multi_key equivalents are present
#   regardless whether they make sense, and whether they barely work.
#
#   Three Multi_key sequences do not work because <numbersign> is used both as
#   a group selector and as a base character:
#   <Multi_key><numbersign>                        <numbersign> : "☐" U2610 # BALLOT BOX
#   <Multi_key><numbersign><numbersign>            <numbersign> : "☑" U2611 # BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK emoji
#   <Multi_key><numbersign><numbersign><numbersign><numbersign> : "☒" U2612 # BALLOT BOX WITH X
#   With respect to dead key use, these topmost sequences are maintained, but
#   related Multi_key equivalents are actionable only in groups 5 through 7.
#   See # # C01
#
#   To manually verify the absence of other conflicts and duplicates, assuming
#   no space between the angle brackets around the keysyms, except that part of
#   the keysyms may be aligned to the end for readability and maintainability:
#
#       1  Remove all comment lines:
#       ^#.*\n
#
#       2  Remove all multi char output for live keys:
#       ^<[^>]+> * : .+\n
#
#       3  Remove all keypad equivalents:
#       .+<KP_.+\n
#
#       4  Start-align end-aligned keysyms (replace all):
#       ^([^ ]+)( *)([^ ]+)( : .*)\n
#       $1$3$2$4\n
#
#       5  Sort lines ascending.
#
#       6  Check for duplicates:
#       ^([^ ]+) .+\n\1\s
#
#       7  Check for conflicts (other than U2610, U2611 and U2612):

# # Legacy ordinal indicators
#
#   The two Latin-1 ordinal indicators "ª" U00AA FEMININE ORDINAL INDICATOR and
#   "º" U00BA MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR are legacy characters, superseded by
#   the use of preformatted superscript small letters for ordinal indicators in
#   Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, also supporting plural forms. Consistently
#   French ordinal indicators are preformatted superscripts, too: ᵈ, ᵉ, ʳ, ˢ.
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/01d3fe0c2168336453b5ec1a34837da1ba9fbc6c/common/main/fr.xml#L1528

#   group 12.

# # Abbreviations, Units and Legal Symbols
#
#   Sequences for "©" U00A9 and "®" U00AE made out of letters only with an O or
#   an o are based on en_US.UTF-8/Compose where "℗" U2117 is missing as well as
#   ASCII fallback sequences "(C)" and "(R)", probably because the latter would
#   conflict with "Ȓ" U0212. To mitigate these gaps, an alternative with a pair
#   of leading parentheses is proposed consistently: "()C", "()R", "()P".
#
#   Order may matter as for "©" U00A9 COPYRIGHT SIGN vs "℅" U2105 CARE OF, and
#   case as for "⅍" U214D AKTIESELSKAB vs "℁" U2101 ADDRESSED TO THE SUBJECT,
#   "🄯" U1F12F COPYLEFT SYMBOL vs "℄" U2104 CENTRE LINE SYMBOL.
#
#   Reverse ¦SA conflicts with "ر.س" Saudi Riyal and "♐" U2650 SAGITTARIUS.
#
#   Many abbreviations allow for a shortcut skipping the slash, but in the case
#   of "℆" U2106, this shortcut requires space termination to prevent conflicts
#   with an input method for the union symbol "∪" U222A based on its nickname.
#
#   S O sequences are used fo mathematical symbols, reverse sequences are used
#   for circled letters, other casing pairs are used for German eszett and for
#   the section sign: "§" U00A7 vs "ß" U00DF vs "ẞ" U1E9E.
#
#   Title case and camel case sequences are also supported; en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#   supports mixed-case sequences as well. E.g. for the Numero sign "№" U2116,
#   it has <N><o> and <N><O>; adding the other two makes for lenient Caps Lock.
#
#   "¦" U00A6 by ¦|: or ¦:| is discarded due to conflicts with DIAERESIS&MACRON
#   Multi_key equivalents.
#
#   Precomposed ("℃" U2103, "℉" U2109, "Å" U212B) and dedicated unit symbols
#   ("K" U212A) are supported as they are in the Letterlike Symbols block. This
#   however was not fully supported before v1.6.0. Prior to v1.6.0, important
#   symbols were missing due to not being used in mathematics. This odd time is
#   over since version 1.6.0 added primarily the VERSICLE and RESPONSE symbols
#   "℣" U2123, "℟" U211F, both by Multi_key and in letter groups 1 and 4.

# # Dashes and hyphens

#   U2010 is not mapped on live key, nor in group 1 of HYPHEN-MINUS, given that
#   its correct representation is the ASCII hyphen U002D. Assigning it an extra
#   scalar has mainly had the adverse effect of fooling two font designers into
#   giving U002D a hybrid glyph, fitting neither the expectations for a hyphen,
#   nor those for a minus sign, fully expressing its genericity, pointed out in
#   the Code Chart: “used generically for hyphen, minus sign or en dash, all of
#   which have dedicated alternatives”. The disconnect is in “all of which”.
#
#   U002D HYPHEN-MINUS is the only ASCII punctuation whose usage is discouraged
#   in currrent writing. So, U2010 appears to be a duplicate encoding of U002D,
#   as shown in the Unicode Character Database (shortened):
#
#       <char cp="002D" age="1.1" na="HYPHEN-MINUS" gc="Pd" ea="Na" lb="HY" SB="SC" blk="ASCII"/>
#       <char cp="2010" age="1.1" na="HYPHEN"       gc="Pd" ea="A"  lb="BA" SB="XX" blk="Punctuation"/>
#
#   Noteworthy differences are in East Asian width, in the line break class and
#   in the sentence break property. The Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm UAX #14
#   does not require an extra hyphen for non-numerical contexts, and HY is BA.
#   https://unicode.org/reports/tr14/#HY
#   East Asian width neither warrants a duplicate hyphen since Unicode includes
#   UFF0D FULLWIDTH HYPHEN-MINUS, and HYPHEN as “ambiguous” resolves to narrow.
#   As of text segmentation, HYPHEN is unspecified, rather than SContinue like
#   HYPHEN-MINUS, and the relevant specification skips “XX” entirely.
#   https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#SContinue
#   Bottom line: U2010 is a useless duplicate of U002D and should be prevented
#   from fully deploying its adverse effects when taking up a live key position
#   or even an easy-access dead key input method like in group 1 of U002D. Else
#   U2010 would screw everything up from undeliverable email to broken links to
#   parse errors. It may be input using the following mnemonic scheme.
#   See # # Long dashes
#
#       HYPHEN-MINUS   = quarter-dash (French “tiret quart-de-cadratin”)
#       HYPHEN         = quarter-dash (French “tiret quart-de-cadratin”)
#       EN DASH        = half dash (French “tiret demi-cadratin”)
#       HORIZONTAL BAR = three-quarter-dash (in Cambria, or conjoining em dash)
#       EM DASH        = full dash (French “tiret cadratin”)
#       TWO-EM DASH    = indicates missing letters, or a missing word
#       THREE-EM DASH  = used for a missing word, or author’s name repetition
#
#   About the latter two, see https://jkorpela.fi/dashes.html
#   and linked https://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2010-m01/0219.html
#
#   "‑" U2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN is also in group 1 of <equal> .
#   Nevertheless, "‐" U2010 HYPHEN is also in group 2 of <minus>.

# # Vulgar fractions
#
#   Since the design of this file was changed to become standalone,
#   support for vulgar fractions needed to be reimplemented.
#
#   Consistently with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, 2-digit sequences support the
#   fractions as more frequently used than circled digits, but ⅒ is now
#   <Multi_key><1><1>, not <Multi_key><1><1><0>.
#
#   For a predictable, intuitive, consistent, versatile user experience,
#   sequences with a slash are also supported, and fraction numerator 1,
#   initially <Multi_key><1><slash>, is extended with space accordingly,
#   while its short sequence <Multi_key><1><space> is still supported.
#
#   Freely composed vulgar fractions may use "⁄" U2044 FRACTION SLASH.
#   The fraction slash triggers autoformatting of base digits to vulgar
#   fractions in Unicode-conformant rendering engines, like HarfBuzz in
#   Firefox.
#   See # # Fraction slash
#
#   A workaround for defective renderers is using superscript digits for
#   numerators, and subscript digits for denominators, with the negative
#   kerning around FRACTION SLASH independently of OpenType support. The
#   result is acceptable if super- and subscripts align between baseline
#   and caps height.

#   In keysymdef.h, 15 bullets are supported, but some comments do not match.
#   This supports the keysyms as implemented, adding support for the intended
#   open rectangular bullet, evidently wrong since the output is filled. This
#   literal is removed for demo on systems working without literals; since it
#   outputs an unintended character, it could be downright discarded as well.
#   Japanese tainome and kome are also supported.

#   Due to its design, the traditional heart Multi_key sequence is supported in
#   a dead_circumflex Multi_key equivalent with digit 3 as the base character:

#   Consistently, U2764 is supported by the traditional sequence.
#
#   U2665 is disambiguated by leading space as if it was a math symbol, but in

# # Design of math sequences
#
#   For a conflictless support of variable length sequences, space termination
#   is required for math symbols, except for longest sequences. Both the ASCII
#   space and the no-break space, on level 3 on the spacebar, are supported as
#   terminating space.
#
#   When things do not work as expected, the likely culprit is a conflict with
#   a dead key equivalent. To fix these issues, sequences may start with space
#   or with no-break space. No-break space instead of space is supported for a
#   better synergy with the Multi_key dead key, on level 3 across modes, while
#   the space character in synergy with Multi_key is no-break space in French
#   mode, ASCII space in ASCII mode, i.e. when ModLock is on.
#   Examples: "≪" U226A and "≫" U226B, "⋘" U22D8 and "⋙" U22D9.
#
#   Leading space is also used to disambiguate math sequences from each other
#   in case intuitivity requires similar sequences for different symbols. This
#   may require prepending multiple spaces. In case of multiple leading spaces,
#   the thumb may be lifted from the level 3 modifier after any of them, also
#   in French mode, i.e. when ModLock is off.
#
#   Examples involving a double, triple, or quadruple leading [nobreak]space:
#   Double:    "⧂" U29C2, "⧜" U29DC, "⧸" U29F8, "◽" U25FD, "⤶" U2936;
#   Triple:    "⟋" U27CB and "⟍" U27CD;
#   Quadruple: "⧵" U29F5, "⁄" U2044.
#
#   To prevent further conflicts with dead key equivalents, negated sequences
#   work the other way around: letters first, slash last, space to terminate,
#   except when required otherwise for disambiguation in partial negation, as
#   in ≇ U2247 vs "≆" U2246. E.g. "∄" U2204, "∅" U2205, "∉" U2209.
#
#   The symbols with less or equal, greater or equal semantics are redesigned.
#   To support both the straight variant "≤" U2264, "≥" U2265, and the slanted
#   variant, sequences with underscore are repurposed, and sequences with minus
#   are introduced since those with equals are needed for "≦" U2266, "≧" U2267.
#   This applies to all symbols with “or equal to” semantics. If the equals is
#   double line, sequences with equals sign are used; if it is single line, the
#   ASCII minus is used; if the equals is slanted, underscore is used, a single
#   underscore for single-line equals, two underscores for double-line equals,
#   e.g. "⪛" U2A9B. See also "⋚" U22DA vs "⪋" U2A8B.
#
#   The slanted variants "⩽" U2A7D and "⩾" U2A7E, preferred in French, are also
#   in group 2 of < and >.
#
#   For consistency, Multi_key sequences starting with slash, pipe, or backslash
#   followed by a trailing digit are in the corresponding dead keys, where they
#   are not space terminated.
#   Slash: "∕" U2215, "⧸" U29F8, "⟋" U27CB, "⁄" U2044.
#   See #*# STROKE
#   Vertical bar: "⫾" U2AFE, "∣" U2223, "‖" U2016, "⦀" U2980, "∥" U2225,
#   "¦" U00A6, "⫴" U2AF4, "⫿" U2AFF, "⏸" U23F8, "⫼" U2AFC.
#   See #*# MACRON
#   Backslash: "∖" U2216, "⧹" U29F9, "⟍" U27CD, "⧵" U29F5.
#   See #*# REVERSED
#
#   Sequences including quotedbl need to be replicated using EuroSign instead,
#   since the euro sign replaces quotedbl on AltGr/Option + E.
#
#   Sequences including semicolon need to be replicated using section instead,
#   since the section sign replaces the semicolon in French mode.
#
#   As rightsinglequotemark is on the apostrophe key in French mode, sequences
#   with apostrophe work also with rightsinglequotemark, although apostrophe is
#   on the next key, E05, on the same (base) level as rightsinglequotemark.
#
#
# # Not sign
#
#   The not sign is also in group 2 of grave on the N key.
#
#   These sequences need to be consistent with those of "⫬" U2AEC and "⫭" U2AED
#   below. There is also a not-math turned not sign "⌙" U2319.

#   Order matters unlike in en_US.UTF-8/Compose not supporting "∓" U2213.
#   Still for backwards compatibility, space termination is skipped, for both

# # Letterlike symbols in block U2100 used in mathematics
#
#   Other alphanumeric mathematical symbols are supported in groups 6 to 10,
#   including some of these that have extra signatures here for convenience.
#   The liter symbol "ℓ" U2113 goes extra, "𝓁" U1D4C1 is encoded separately.
#   Space termination is skipped where obviously dispensable.

#   "⧵" U29F5 REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR: likely duplicate "∖" U2216 SET MINUS
#   with the potential to fool people into decisions causing issues, e.g.
#   “\setminus translated as U+29F5 ⧵ REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR causes problems #409”
#   https://github.com/tudace/tuda_latex_templates/issues/409
#   Fonts, e.g. DejaVu Sans Mono Book, may give them a slight difference in slant.
#   Since "∕" U2215 DIVISION SLASH does not have any *SOLIDUS OPERATOR equivalent,
#   REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR is disambiguated by a quadruple leading space.
#   For convenience these [back]slash symbols are alternatively disambiguated
#   by a trailing digit, for consistency also those with a single leading space.

# # LaTeX codes
#
#   Since the maximum number of keysyms is 9, many LaTeX commands need to be
#   truncated to make working Multi_key sequences out of them, limiting this
#   input method’s usability.
#
#   Most short sequences require space termination for disambiguation. This
#   is also consistent with TeX control words.

### Dead keys
#
#   The X Keyboard Extension does not have dead keys of its own; it relies on
#   XCompose to emulate dead key behavior instead. Other systems may not have
#   any dedicated Multi_key functionality. However, Multi_key behavior can be
#   emulated using chained dead keys.
#
#   Input composition implemented by chaining dead keys is more powerful in
#   that it supports modularity, as opposed to XCompose that requires listing
#   all supported sequences, verbatim and in extenso. The reason why is that
#   this does not work:
#
#       <dead_circumflex> <dead_circumflex> : dead_belowcircumflex
#   or:
#       <dead_circumflex> <dead_circumflex> : <dead_belowcircumflex>
#   then:
#       <dead_belowcircumflex> <e>          : "ḙ" U1E19 # LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX BELOW
#
#   That however contradicts what X.org specifies:
#
#       If the string is omitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according
#       to the current locale.
#
#       I.e., if a rule looks like:
#           <dead_grave>     <A> : "\300" Agrave
#       the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.
#       But if the rule is:
#           <dead_grave> <A> : Agrave
#       the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.
#
#   https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.html
#
#
# # Notes on Unicode support
#
#   The extended Latin F & G blocks are supported since 2023-05-25T1205+0200.
#   This does not affect ChromeOS, Linux, MacOS (macOS), as opposed to Windows,
#   where the Text Services Framework (TSF) is no longer able to keep the Latin
#   script easy to input. Transpiling the related sequences to C will require a
#   move to low surrogates from U10780 to U1DF2A (U1DFFF) along with a facility
#   to input the D801 and D837 high surrogates.
#   https://unicode.org/versions/enumeratedversions.html
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-F
#
#   Due to more comprehensive support for Unicode characters used in Latin
#   script as encoded since version 1.1 of the Standard, some sequences in
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose need to be redefined, by making more extensive use
#   of ASCII symbols and punctuation.
#
#   With the Multi_key thought of as a generic dead key taking arguments,
#   the base letter that those modifications are applied to is typed last.
#   This pattern performs much better, as it empowers XCompose to apply
#   multiple diacritics as used e.g. in Vietnamese and Lithuanian.
#
#   As a result, semantics of paired punctuation may be switched compared to
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose. Examples of Multi_key equivalents for dead_breve:
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose: <Multi_key><a><parenleft>
#   In new-school Compose:  <Multi_key><parenright><a>
#   This scheme is not proper to new school, since in en_US.UTF-8/Compose we
#   already have U-shape:   <Multi_key><U><a>
#   As well as the initial: <Multi_key><b><a>
#
#   While that change alone would not warrant a comprehensive overhaul, more
#   tweaks are required, such as supporting superscript and subscript, using
#   asciicircum and underscore repurposed, formerly circumflex and macron.
#
#   So, when "<" and ">" are used for circumflex and hacek (aka hatchek, caron)
#   and "|" for macron, ":" gets used for diaeresis like in Vim, and <quotedbl>
#   looks fine for double acute accent. A change that is the more desirable as
#   it also fixes an issue with sequences for curly quotation marks.
#
#   Bottom line: Full Unicode support requires an upgraded Multi_key scheme aka
#   new-school input composition.

# # Introducing new-school input composition
#
#   "^" and "_" need to be freed up for super- and subscript/smallcap, applying
#   the parentheses-breve scheme to circumflex and hacek, macron and diaeresis.
#   For example, new-school Multi_key sequences include ¦^ for superscript,
#   ¦> for hacek, ¦< for circumflex accent, ¦| for macron, ¦: for diaeresis,
#   ¦" for the double acute accent that is an acute diaeresis. That helps avoid
#   conflicts with the dead key based input method for apostrophe/comma-shaped
#   double quotation marks.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   Another reason to adopt new-school is that in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, <comma>
#   is used for both dead_cedilla and dead_ogonek, resulting in a conflict on E
#   that en_US.UTF-8/Compose works around by using <cedilla> instead of <comma>
#   in the Multi_key sequences yielding U0228 and U0229. If <semicolon> were
#   used as the Multi_key equivalent of both dead_belowcomma and dead_ogonek,
#   the result would be yet another dead key merger, rightfully avoided in
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#   Yet another reason is that en_US.UTF-8/Compose, using dead_hook both for
#   hook and hook above, is unable to support "Ƴ" U01B3 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y
#   WITH HOOK and "ƴ" U01B4 LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH HOOK, proving the
#   existing scheme as impracticable.
#
#
# # Virtual dead keys
#
#   The French BÉPO ergonomic keyboard layout defines a number of dead keys as
#   virtualized by dead key double press. The diacritic is either doubled or
#   transformed, i.e. it is shifted to the less frequently diacriticized side
#   of the letter. More information is available in French on the bépo website:
#   https://bepo.fr/wiki/Version_1.1rc1/Touches_mortes/Pressions_multiples
#
#   Based on this, triple or quadruple press virtual dead keys may also be
#   supported as required. Additionally, mixing multiple diacritics on the
#   same letter also requires virtual dead keys. Each one of these dead keys
#   needs a dedicated dead character.
#
#
# # X11 dead key syms defined in keysymdef.h
#
#   Dead keys are defined for Latin and Greek keyboards and for other input
#   methods. Some new dead keys already have a keysym defined in keysymdef.h;
#   an update package can be installed with this command:
#
#       sudo apt-get install x11proto-core-dev
#
#   For Latin keyboard layouts. The 21 keysyms used in this layout are checked:
#
#      dead_abovecomma
#    ✔ dead_abovedot
#      dead_abovereversedcomma
#    ✔ dead_abovering
#      dead_aboveverticalline
#    ✔ dead_acute
#      dead_belowbreve
#      dead_belowcircumflex

#
# # Bar and stroke diacritics
#
#   The keysym dead_stroke was previously used for the horizontal dash overlay,
#   a.k.a. bar, given that one dead key is not enough to support both "/" and
#   "-" shaped diacritics, so to cater for Karl Pentzlin’s new German T3 layout
#   (DIN 2137:2012), dead_longsolidusoverlay was added based on the name of the
#   diacritic used to decompose negated math symbols: "̸" U0338 COMBINING LONG
#   SOLIDUS OVERLAY. (Letters like Oslash "Ø" U00D8 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH
#   STROKE are not decomposed.) The T3 also required another three new keysyms:
#   dead_aboveverticalline, dead_belowverticalline, dead_lowline, although none
#   of these has any precomposed letters, and Windows’ TSF dead keys are unable
#   to support decomposed (NFD/NFKD) letters. But the stroke-bar disambiguation
#   made a good point for adding the “extra dead elements for German T3 layout”
#   alongside the use of vertical line below, and its alternate representation
#   vertical line above, in Yoruba and in other languages.
#
#   Initially, the new keysym was called `dead_longsolidus`, and `dead_stroke`
#   was disruptively renamed to `dead_shortstroke` as well.
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=85370
#
#   Alas, en_US.UTF-8/Compose has not been updated in the wake. One decade down
#   the road, while dead_longsolidusoverlay was (expectedly) in use at least in
#   Cimbali’s partial implementation (skipping unsupported dead key content) of
#   the newly standardized French AZERTY (NF Z71-300, https://norme-azerty.fr/,
#   `/usr/share/X11/symbols/fr(afnor)`), that explicitly supports "Ł" U0141 and
#   "ł" U0142 as well as "Ƚ" U023D and "ƚ" U019A (another casing letter pair is
#   less completely enumerated in the standard), Ghost User (@ghost) managed to
#   toss it out of keysymdef.h.
#   https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/xorgproto/-/merge_requests/70
#
#   The resulting regression was bluntly released in libxkbcommon 1.6.0.
#   https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2023-October/043121.html
#   https://www.reddit.com/r/openSUSE/comments/17guwgm/comment/k6p6ul2/
#
#   In Cimbali’s French AFNOR layout, dead_longsolidusoverlay was replaced with
#   a second instance of dead_stroke.
#
#   So, none of the 2 French standard layouts can be implemented anymore, using
#   XKB named keysyms only.
#
#   The outcome is not so bad, as dead_stroke is stroke again, while *dead_bar
#   becomes the ninth Private Use Area keysym used for dead keys in this file:
#   UEFD8, after UEFD0..UEFD7, plus UEFD9, UEFDA.
#
#
# # Macron below and line below
#
#   The deadkeysym dead_lowline is not used to input precomposed letters having
#   “WITH LINE BELOW” in their name, given in the Latin Extended Additional
#   block, “the names "WITH LINE BELOW" refer to a macron below the letter.”
#   https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_1E00.html
#
#   These letters are input using dead_belowmacron, which may be virtualized by
#   double press of dead_macron.
#   See #^# MACRON_BELOW
#
#   Letters with a real line below are used in languages of Gabon and in Oneida
#   and require a line-below dead key, standardized in ISO/IEC 9995-11, where
#   dead keys output combining diacritics to begin with, for post-processing by
#   applications on Windows that part 11 of the standard has been designed for.
#   See #^# LINE_BELOW
#
#   As the output only consists in an added combining diacritic to any letter
#   typed after, implementing this dead key on non-Windows keyboards requires
#   knowing the list of letters expected to be supported.
#
#   (Although U0332 COMBINING LOW LINE is defined as connecting, it may not be
#   used to underline a text span in plain text, due to vertical alignment
#   issues under lowercase letters with descender.)
#
#
# # Hook, hook above and retroflex hook
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, dead_hook is used both for hook and hook above.
#   The consequence is that en_US.UTF-8/Compose is unable to support "Ƴ" U01B3
#   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH HOOK and "ƴ" U01B4 LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH
#   HOOK. Hence the need for a keysym dedicated to letters with hook above,
#   e.g. *dead_abovehook.
#
#   Another hook dead key is added because new-school input composition takes
#   advantage of the brace symmetry to alleviate the overloaded dead_hook by
#   adding *dead_retroflexhook.
#
#
# # Proposed additional dead key syms
#
#   These 8 additional dead keys are required for supporting the Latin script,
#   and also for consistency with the 30 ASCII symbols and punctuation mapped
#   on level 3 of the keys in rows B..D, columns 1..10.
#
#   *dead_abovehook (see # # Hook, hook above and retroflex hook)
#   *dead_bar (see # # Bar and stroke diacritics)
#   *dead_group (this AZERTY has also an extra key for this dead key)
#   *dead_flag (regional indicator letters, U1F1E6..U1F1FF)
#   *dead_retroflexhook (see # # Hook, hook above and retroflex hook)
#   *dead_reversed (~50 Latin letters)
#   *dead_subscript (smallcap when the base letter is uppercase)
#   *dead_superscript (used as modifier letter and abbreviation indicator)
#   *dead_turned (~70); inverted (20) or sideways (8) on double press
#
#   An alias is also proposed:
#
#   *dead_circled for the virtual dead_greek double press
#
#
# # Dead keys not included in keysymdef.h
#
#   Some additional dead keys proposed for mapping on an fr-FR keyboard are listed below.
#   See # # Dead characters for portability

#   <UEFD0> : "①"   *dead_group, for 12 additional groups (0-based). Multi_key: ¦#
#   <UEFD1> : "^"   *dead_superscript, phonetics / abbreviation indicatrs. Multi_key: ¦^
#                   As abbreviation indicators, superscripts need to be on live keys.
#                   dead_circumflex is not ¦^ but ¦< in new-school Compose.
#   <UEFD2> : "_"   *dead_subscript is required for phonetics as it traditionally
#                   also includes small caps.
#   <UEFD3> : "ẻ"   *dead_abovehook, required for disambiguation with dead_hook. Multi_key: ¦]
#   <UEFD4> : "ɖ"   *dead_retroflexhook, required for disambiguation, consistent with the

#   <UEFD5> : "ᴚ"   *dead_turned, technically easiest transform. ~70 instances. Multi_key: ¦%
#                   double-press: inverted (20 instances) or sideways (8 letters) in Latin;
#                   inverted and sideways have an empty intersection. Multi_key: ¦%
#   <UEFD6> : "ᴙ"   *dead_reversed, second-most frequent transform. ~50 (Latin). Multi_key: ¦\
#   <UEFD7> : "⚐"   *dead_flag — The Regional Indicator Symbols dead key. Multi_key: ¦=
#   <UEFD8> : "ħ"   *dead_bar for barred letters, i.e. with a horizontal stroke. Multi_key: ¦-

#
# # Order of dead key lists
#
#   There is no obvious order for the dead keys, since keysyms are unintuitive
#   or non-existent, most code points are arbitrary and unmnemonic, and common
#   names are challenging due to language and conventions. By lack of anything
#   better, dead keys are ordered following the keyboard layout as in the list
#   below.
#
#   That order is based on the assumption that those ASCII symbols are mapped
#   in a stable manner.
#
#   However, prior to v2, this ASCII map was unstable, due to a combination of
#   underengineering and lack of consultancy, which is a euphemism for impiety.
#   https://github.com/dispoclavier/nouvel-azerty/blob/80fb0969cc0c0b465357b8e6ee9552eca3b21074/linux-chromeos/dispocla.cpp#L396
#
#
# # Proposed dead key layout for AZERTY keyboards
#
#   30 out of 32 ASCII symbols and punctuation are mapped on level 3 of keys
#   (B..D)(01..10), and 28 dead keys are mapped on level 4 of the same keys
#   as the ASCII characters used to emulate those dead keys by Multi_key, using
#   new-school input composition. New-school composition is designed to fully
#   support the Latin script.
#
#   One of those two dead keys that is not mapped on the same key as the symbol
#   used to emulate it by Multi_key is dead_abovedot, mapped on P where level 3
#   ampersand is unrelated. However, period is mapped on level 5, to be used on
#   the extended numpad as a decimal separator, alongside comma on key C10 (M).
#
#   The other exception is dead_cedilla on the comma key where level 3 question
#   mark is not an equivalent of any dead key either.
#
#   As a result, dead keys are related to the ASCII symbols mapped on the same
#   keys by multiple easy mnemonics.
#
#   In the Windows implementation of these keyboard layouts, AltGr level 3 is
#   an additional level, 0x10 or Right Oyayubi, without Caps Lock support, but
#   free from the numerous bugs affecting the AltGr level that Windows emulates
#   using Ctrl + Alt. These bugs are fixed on application level, as in MS Word.
#   That is one reason why levels 3 and 4 are not used for casing characters.
#   See Mark Durdin’s article about “Robust key message handling in Windows”:
#   https://blog.keyman.com/2008/06/robust-key-mess/

# # Order of mixed dead keys
#
#   Dead key combinations, called chained dead keys on Windows, are actionable
#   both ways for two diacritics, except when order matters, for diacritics to
#   be positioned above, stacked in one order or the other way around, e.g. on
#   "Ṻ" U1E7A and "ṻ" U1E7B versus "Ǖ" U01D5 and "ǖ" U01D6, or when a Multi_key
#   equivalent would conflict with another input method, e.g. "Ḉ" U1E08 and "ḉ"
#   U1E09 with "ʻ" U02BB by dead_acute, "Ǘ" U01D7 and "ǘ" U01D8 with "‚" U201A.
#
#   Diacritic or transformational dead keys applied to letters in groups are
#   to be hit first, before the group selector. That behavior is consistent,
#   it helps streamline code and maintenance, and it prevents conflicts.
#
#
# # Quotation mark input method
#
#   A complete set of current curly quotes is input on unshifted keys, thanks
#   to the fact that both the involved dead keys and the base characters have
#   base level mappings.
#
#   This is part of the dead key enhancement based on considering each dead key
#   a group selector activating the "<dead key> group", e.g. "circumflex group"
#   or "dead_circumflex group".
#
#   Overview
#
#       Acute accent: high           closing or opening   U2019, U201D
#       See #*# ACUTE
#
#       Circumflex:   turned high    opening or closing   U2018, U201C
#       See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#       Diaeresis:    low            opening              U201A, U201E
#       See #*# DIAERESIS
#
#   Additionally, some rare quotation marks are also supported, with a dead key
#   that is not on the base level:
#
#       Grave accent: reversed high  opening              U201B, U201F
#       See #*# GRAVE
#
#       Double grave, or diaeresis + grave:    reversed low      U2E42
#
#   This input method is fostered by using dead_doubleacute, consistently with
#   ASCII double quote replaced with EuroSign on key D03, level 3. This dead
#   key does not have many base characters, preventing conflicts in the wake.
#   See #*# DOUBLE_ACUTE
#
#   The <rightsinglequotemark> base character takes into account that the ASCII
#   apostrophe on row E is replaced with rightsinglequotemark, to enhance UX in
#   French mode, i.e. ModLock off. This is also an unconflicting base character
#   fostering this quotation mark input method.
#
#   ASCII <apostrophe> is supported alongside for interoperability, and because
#   it is mapped on the base level of key E05 next to rightsinglequotemark. The
#   conflicts of Multi_key equivalents with CIRCUMFLEX&ACUTE, DIAERESIS&ACUTE,
#   are fixed by hitting these dead keys the other way around.
#   See # # CIRCUMFLEX&ACUTE
#   See # # ACUTE&DIAERESIS
#   See # # DIAERESIS&ACUTE
#   See # # ACUTE&GRAVE, GRAVE&ACUTE
#
#   The highly backwards compatible layouts, without these easily accessed dead
#   keys, have a tilde dead key closer to quotedbl than the acute accent, so an
#   easier alternative is provided by replicating the quotation mark sequences
#   of dead_acute in dead_tilde, also with respect to synergies on level 3 of
#   regular layouts.
#
#   The character descriptors in lowercase are Unicode informative aliases that
#   have been given in case of a suboptimal name.
#
#   Ornamental quotation marks are input by dead key followed by group selector.
#   SMP quotation mark ornaments U1F676.. are not supported, for cross platform
#   compatibility.
#
#
# # Mathematical symbols
#
#   Approximation: See #*# TILDE
#   Negation:      See #*# STROKE
#   Equality:      See #*# FLAG
#
#   Negated symbols may alternatively be input using (Base-level) dead_acute,
#   since no symbols have been encoded with an acute accent.
#   Mnemonics is based on the slant of the accent.
#
#   Equality symbols may alternatively be input using (Base-level) dead_diaeresis,
#   since no symbols have been encoded with a diaeresis.
#   Mnemonics is based on the double dot and its Multi_key equivalent colon.
#
#
# # Spacing modifier letters and clones of diacritics
#
#   An input method based on overtyping reportedly existed on very old systems.
#   Most of the spacing diacritics in Latin-1 were replaced with actual letters
#   in Latin-15, but other symbols were replaced too while a diacritic remained.
#   The Unicode Standard states in §7.9 that it is not clear whether diacritics
#   were combining or standalone. Using the latter as dead characters (Windows)
#   or terminators (macOS) in dead keys is not possible consistently throughout
#   and is a reason why many keyboard layouts are not streamlined, and dead key
#   behavior is inconsistent. Examples include a dedicated 'ê' key while 'ê' is
#   better supported by configuring the circumflex accent dead key accordingly,
#   as well as unrelated dead characters for hook, horn, and most combinations.
#   Unicode added U02D8..U02DD to the Latin-1 diacritics merely for roundtrip
#   compatibility with pre-existing character sets.
#
#   Both NBSP (AltGr + SP) and NNBSP (AltFr + SP) are used as base characters.
#   Since DIAERESIS and CEDILLA do exist only in Latin-1, they are accessible
#   both ways. By contrast, Latin-1 MACRON and ACUTE ACCENT are duplicates of
#   modifier letters (by NNBSP) and are accessible by NBSP exclusively. Then,
#   ASCII symbols GRAVE ACCENT, CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT, TILDE are included as well.
#
#
# # Dead characters for portability
#
#   This representative sign works on Windows as the so-called dead character.
#   On MacOS it is the terminator. Both OSes output it when the base character
#   is not listed with the current dead key, prior to outputting the unchanged
#   base character itself. XCompose, by contrast, has no output in this case.
#
#   Traditionally, this character is output in isolation on hitting space after
#   a dead key, but space is now reserved for the related combining diacritic,
#   and this is inappropriate as a dead character, because dead characters must
#   be spacing so as to be clearly distinguishable and keep user experience on
#   a correct level, also with respect to the use on macOS of these characters
#   as terminators displayed on a yellow background while a sequence is ongoing
#   (as opposed to both XKB and Windows, where the user gets no feedback).
#
#   The topmost reason for picking the base character from the dead key output
#   is that an Ê-key emulation on the circumflex accent dead key requires ê as
#   a dead character in dead_circumflex, and so does the Ç-key emulation for ç
#   in dead_cedilla.
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#   See #*# CEDILLA
#
#   Moreover, many diacritics do not have a spacing clone.
#
#   Consistently, dead keys have their dead character picked from their output.
#
#   For dead_tilde, the dead character base letter is `e` for consistency with
#   dead_belowtilde, that is precomposed only with e, i, u, and for equity, as
#   opposed to picking one of ã, ñ, õ, and thus favoring either Portuguese or
#   Spanish. The ẽ also makes for consistent mnemonics since tilde ends in e.
#   See #*# TILDE
#   See #^# MIDDLE_TILDE
#
#   For portability, the dead characters are defined in the dead key headings:
#
#       #*# SUPERSCRIPT
#       #   *dead_superscript UEFD1
#       #   Multi_key: ¦^
#       #   Dchar: "^" U005E
#
#   A projected transpiler shall read in this dead character and use it for the
#   DEADTRANS function calls on Windows, supporting an implementable subset (no
#   strings). That is yet to be implemented (idea 2023-11-06T0603+0100).
#
#   For documentation, a list of dead character candidates is provided here.
#   For natively unsupported dead keys, a keysym candidate is proposed as well.

#
#   The Multi_key sequences by contrast are built using generic dead characters
#   in a private use area, because there are too many of them, and it is better
#   to have a .notdef box output on failure rather than an unintended character
#   or two of them (on Windows).
#
#
# # Combining diacritics
#
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose has combining diacritics with <nobreakspace>, probably
#   assuming that both dead keys and NBSP are on level 3, while <space> yields
#   a legacy spacing character as far as this is available; not for dead_hook,
#   dead_belowcomma, dead_doubleacute properly, and severl other dead keys.
#
#   Those among these spacing characters that are in the ASCII range, as ^, ~,
#   ` are not usefully generated by dead key, because they should be easily
#   accessible on live keys.
#
#   Hence it is proposed to use space as a base character to get the combining
#   diacritic throughout, as implemented since 2010 on J. ‘Mach’ Wust’s 
#   US Custom keyboard layout for macOS:
#   http://uscustom.sourceforge.net/
#
#   Indeed the Unicode Standard version 11.0.0, section 5.2, page 220 states:
#
#      A common implementation for the input of combining character sequences
#      is the use of dead keys. These keys match the mechanics used by
#      typewriters to generate such sequences through overtyping the base
#      character after the nonspacing mark. In computer implementations,
#      keyboards enter a special state when a dead key is pressed for the
#      accent and emit a precomposed character only when one of a limited
#      number of “legal” base characters is entered. It is straightforward
#      to adapt such a system to emit combining character sequences or
#      precomposed characters as needed.
#
#      Typists, especially in the Latin script, are trained on systems that
#      work using dead keys. However, many scripts in the Unicode Standard
#      (including the Latin script) may be implemented according to the
#      handwriting sequence, in which users type the base character first,
#      followed by the accents or other nonspacing marks (see Figure 5-4).
#
#   As a result, keyboard layouts should feature dead keys as well as easy
#   access to combining marks. Alternative input method for combining marks:
#   https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/Phonetic_symbols__diacritics.html
#
#   Following a principle used in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, the most synergistic
#   character after the default mappings of dead keys on level 4, ZWSP,
#   duplicates the combining diacritics. Conversely, the NBSP is repurposed to
#   yield spacing diacritics as does en_US.UTF-8/Compose with ordinary space.
#
#   "¤" U00A4 # CURRENCY SIGN is an exception to the rule.
#
#   This list supports combining diacritics from U0300 to U0339 plus U1DCB.
#   Items are ordered by dead keys. Combined dead keys are listed last.

#
# # Composed diacriticized letters
#
#   Due to a technical limitation on Windows, caused by defining the wrong data
#   type for dead key output i.e. for the DEADTRANS function’s return value, we
#   cannot get composed letters nor characters from a Supplemental Multilingual
#   Plane output by dead keys in the Text Services Framework of Windows. Hence,
#   this section is not cross-platform compatible. When porting this on Windows
#   programmatically, the script needs to filter out all composed letters while
#   listing them in an extra file for documentation in order to advise to input
#   these sequences on Windows by adding combining diacritics.
#   See # # Combining diacritics
#
#   However, in the Unicode encoding model, precomposed letters with peripheral
#   marks are considered legacy; no new ones are encoded any more.
#   As a result, many composed letters with diacritics are used in practice.
#
#   In XCompose, composed letters must be defined as literal strings.
#   The only Latin composed letter in en_US.UTF-8/Compose is J WITH ACUTE.
#   Cyrillic has more.

#   Sequences with Ɛ, ɛ and Ɔ, ɔ keysyms are for use on the Francophone Africa
#   semiautomatic keyboard layout “kbfrAFs” and its remapped variant “kbfrAFsr”
#   that have live keys for open e (Latin epsilon) and open o.
#
#   The shared list also includes M, m with grave accent. Here this is sorted
#   in dead_grave for consistency.

# # Order of dead keys
#
#   Dead keys in this file are ordered following the AZERTY keyboard layout.
#   See # # Actionable dead key layout for Latin keyboards
#
#   Heading levels are differentiated, in that the main dead keys with mappings
#   on keys are prefixed `#*# `, the dead keys virtualized by double or triple,
#   rarely quadruple press are prefixed `#^# `, and the other dead keys `# # `.
#
#   Dead keys are further ordered following this scheme:
#
#       1.    #*# Main dead key
#       2.    # # Dead key in group
#       3.    # # Dead key combination with one or more other dead keys
#       4.    #^# Dead key virtualized by multiple press
#
#   The order of base characters matters, too, since this file is also used for
#   documentation: spaces, quotedbl, apostrophes, other symbols/punctuation[1],
#   digits, letters. As a result, combining marks and spacing clones of
#   diacritics are listed first, quotation marks come next.
#
#   [1] For consistency and predictability, the other punctuation and the other
#       symbols are ordered following the keyboard layout.
#       See # # Order of dead key lists

#   In Unicode CLDR, French has ordinal indicators ᵈ, ᵉ, ʳ, ˢ since v34 (2018).

#
#   Superscript lowercase letters are most extensively used as abbreviation
#   indicators in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, spoken by one
#   third of the world’s population. Therefore, these letters are on live keys.
#   Support for diacriticized abbreviation indicators is straightforward in the
#   Unicode character encoding model, using combining diacritics.
#
#   The superscript uppercase alphabet is less complete. Yet some of these are
#   used in orthographies. In 2020 and 2021, more uppercase letters were added:
#   C "ꟲ" UA7F2, F "ꟳ" UA7F3, Q "ꟴ" UA7F4.
#   See L2/20-251, cited in the Script Ad Hoc Working Group Report L2/21-016r:
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2021/21016r-script-adhoc-rept.pdf
#
#   Missing S, X, Y, Z are replaced with "∄" U2204 THERE DOES NOT EXIST.
#
#   Superscript small q is part of Unicode since v14.0 released in 2020.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20117-modifier-letter-suppt.pdf
#   There had been an attempt to encode superscript q in isolation, with a good
#   rationale based on two street signs photographed in Paris, pointing to the
#   National Library: “Biblio𐞥ᵘᵉ Nationale”.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2010/10230-modifier-q.pdf
#   One year later, in 2011, a new take argued that the full set of superscript
#   small and capital letters is convenient for keyboard layout design, as this
#   would improve the related user experience.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2011/11208-n4068.pdf
#   The first proposal encountered strong headwinds from the industry.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2010/10315-comment.pdf
#   It was immediately defended by its author during the UTC meeting.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2010/10316-cmts.pdf
#   Both attempts to complete the Latin superscript small letters failed.
#
#   Despite the consensus about including superscript letters in Unicode for
#   phonetic notation, making abbreviation indicators plain text is fiercely
#   opposed by members of the Consortium, for software marketing reasons. And
#   when character names on a MODIFIER LETTER basis were introduced, these were
#   adopted as the new norm for “superscript”. Meanwhile, “subscript” remained
#   unchanged, meaning that preformatted superscript letters should not be used
#   in lieu of formatted letters. But the move was biased, since superscript is
#   a means to carry semantics and is therefore eligible for plain text support
#   in Unicode. Duly disguising subscript likewise was dropped, probably due to
#   running out of technical terms.
#
#   Followed by quotedbl, apostrophe or rightsinglequotemark, dead_superscript
#   yields high curly quotation marks U201D, U2019 (closing or opening) exactly
#   like dead_acute and dead_tilde do, as a facility for keyboard layouts where
#   dead_superscript is on the base level with respect to the need for dumbed-
#   down layout drivers to cater for Windows, shipping some malware designed to
#   destroy the reputation of more complete keyboard layouts.

#   To fill the diacritic slot, "̅" U0305 COMBINING OVERLINE is included, with
#   mnemonics referring to "̲" U0332 COMBINING LOW LINE that fills this slot
#   for the SUBSCRIPT dead key, <Multi_key><underscore>. That is certainly a
#   better option than duplicating the set of circumflexes already provided in
#   dead_circumflex. Consistently, the spacing clone is "‾" U203E.

#   This is based on the small cap semantics of the subscript dead key.
#
#   The fraction slash is supported alongside as a workaround for incomplete
#   keyboard layouts lacking a live key position for U2044. The superscript or
#   subscript dead keys alone cannot include a slash as a base character due to
#   numerous conflicts with math symbols. Yet another input method is included
#   in the slash-shaped set supported by dead_stroke, in slot 4.

#
#   The rotation angle may be 180° as for TURNED letters, or 90° i.e. SIDEWAYS.
#
#   Old Lisu letters are also supported, as they are repurposed for typesetting
#   turned Latin capital letters, also upright for centrally symmetric letters.
#   For an example see the “Propulsé par” (“Powered by”) mention at the bottom:
#   https://humanisme-renaissance.droz.org
#
#   Old Lisu has turned glyphs for A..L, N..P, R..V, X..Z because Q is not used
#   at all, and turned M and W are confusable. "𑾰" U11FB0 has been encoded late
#   and is therefore outside the BMP.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2008/08019-lisu.pdf
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2018/18338r2-lisu-letter-yha.pdf
#
#   The TURNED dead key supports Lisu letters looking like turned Latin letters
#   or like the centrally symmetric H, I, N, O, S, X, Z since these may be used
#   alongside for consistency. But the other Lisu letters, those that cannot be
#   used as turned Latin letters, are not supported, as this works by dead key,
#   meaning that this is not fit for writing Lisu. But due to conflicts, TURNED
#   double press is used for a fuller set.
#
#   "Ǝ" U018E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER REVERSED E is actually used as a _turned_ E,
#   but its usual glyph is really a _reversed_ E, unlike what is done for Lisu.
#   See #*# REVERSED
#
#   Turned punctuation for Spanish is supported both in the turned (single) and
#   inverted (double press) parts to account for the misconceived names.
#
#   The opening parenthesis yields the character tie "⁀" U2040, since this may
#   be considered sideways, or like a vertical parenthesis. The undertie
#   "‿" U203F would conflict with "𐞡" U107A1 by its Multi_key equivalent, but
#   it is supported in the double press virtual dead key *dead_inverted.
#
#   For intuitivity, the Polynesian ʻeta, Hawaiʻian ʻokina can also be input as
#   if it were a turned rightsinglequotemark despite being a letter. Apostrophe
#   is also supported as a base character for this input method.
#   See # # D07
#
#   As a diacritic, "̒" U0312 COMBINING TURNED COMMA ABOVE is included, and its
#   spacing counterpart "ʻ" U02BB MODIFIER LETTER TURNED COMMA alongside (but a
#   better option for typing a U02BB is using group 2 of grave), with no-break
#   space or no-break thin space as a base character.

#   The two parentheses yield the two underties, one of which is inverted:
#   "⁔" U2054, "‿" U203F. For mnemonics, these are like sideways, or vertical
#   parentheses.
#
#   As a diacritic, "̕" U0315 COMBINING COMMA ABOVE RIGHT is included, with the
#   rationale that turning twice may be used to represent a shift to the right.
#   Not "̓" U0313 COMBINING COMMA ABOVE as this is supported in dead_belowcomma
#   double press.
#   See #^# COMMA_ABOVE
#
#   As a spacing clone, letter apostrophe "ʼ" U02BC is picked invariably.

#   This dedicated dead key, supported by XKB, is required to prevent conflicts
#   due to the dead key based quotation mark input method.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   The DOUBLE_ACUTE dead key is also required for consistency with the symbols
#   mapped on level 3, and with the new-school Compose scheme mapping dead keys
#   and ASCII symbols except ampersand and question mark bijectively.
#   See # # Introducing new-school input composition
#
#   Double acute has no reported usage outside Unicode precomposed letters.
#   https://www.frathwiki.com/Double_Acute_Accent
#
#   With digits, dead_doubleacute acts as a shortcut for double circled numbers
#   with “double” mnemonics. Double arrows have their redundancy on *dead_flag.
#   See #^# DOUBLE_CIRCLED
#   See #*# FLAG
#
#   Multi_key sequences with quotedbl are duplicated with EuroSign, to account
#   for the mapping of EuroSign instead of quotedbl for compliance with current
#   hardware and the European Commission’s recommendation.

#   Followed by quotedbl or rightsinglequotemark (or apostrophe[1]), dead_tilde
#   yields high curly quotation marks U201D, U2019 (closing or opening), as a
#   facility for one-handed input of double apostrophe closing quotation marks,
#   taking advantage of the synergy between dead_tilde and quotedbl or EuroSign
#   on level 3 of keys D11 and D03, as well as to improve backwards compatible
#   layouts where dead_acute (usually yielding these quotation marks) is not on
#   level 1, but on level 3, key E01, next to the tilde dead key on E02, and
#   quotedbl is on E03 as usual.
#   [1] By apostrophe, the Multi_key equivalent conflicts with TILDE AND ACUTE,
#       so this is commented out.

#   The tilde dead key supports daggers, because it is mapped on key T due to
#   alphabetic mnemonics, and daggers are tied to T by shape-based mnemonics.
#   The full set of daggers is available by digits 1 through 6 with shape-based
#   mnemonics for simple, double and triple daggers, by 1 through 3, and numpad
#   positional mnemonics for left/right guard daggers, by 4 and 6 respectively,
#   around the turned dagger by 5.
#   Umihotaru’s 'Nishiki-teki' font supports "⹋" U2E4B TRIPLE DAGGER.
#   See # # C10
#
#   Lithuanian requires a hard dot on i and j. The sequences with dot above are
#   a workaround, since the hard dot on i and j is a feature of Lithuanian, and
#   should not depend on user input, but on font settings instead.
#

#   "≃" U2243 and "≈" U2248 are both supported by equal based on keypress
#   number mnemonics.

#   Greek dead key update
#
#   When dead_greek was designed and added to en_US.UTF-8/Compose far ahead of
#   ISO/IEC 9995-9, mappings were not yet synced with the Greek keyboard. That
#   is the reason of the discrepancies between en_US.UTF-8/Compose and current
#   keyboard standards, like NF Z71-300:2019 in sync with ISO/IEC 9995-9:2016.

#   The Greek dead key is mapped on D06 with the Y mnemonics of 'Greek I' (i grec).
#   Should this position be used otherwise, dead_greek is not indispensable, as
#   the Greek letters can be accessed in group 6.
#   See # # GROUP_6

#   The diacritic slot is used for the combining ypogegrammeni "ͅ" U0345 as most
#   likely to be useful and expected rather than other diacritical marks. So is
#   the spacing clone slot for "ι" U03B9, for consistency with Greek encoding.

#
#   For non-letters, dead_greek single press is used as a dead key for CIRCLED,
#   alongside dead_greek double press virtualizing the ordinary general-purpose
#   *dead_circled.
#   See #^# CIRCLED
#
#   This dead key applies a scheme where zero yields circled number 10. This is
#   consistent with dead_doubleacute yielding double circled numbers.

#   This scheme starts with zero, since dead_greek double press is not required
#   for double circled digits that have a dedicated dead key and can thus be in
#   dead_greek triple press.

#
#   Followed by quotedbl, apostrophe or rightsinglequotemark, dead_acute
#   yields high curly quotation marks U201D, U2019 (closing or opening).
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   J WITH ACUTE is in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, but Ĳ́ ĳ́ with acute is not rendered
#   correctly in some fonts. It should have an accent on each letter making up
#   the digraph.
#   https://glyphsapp.com/learn/localize-your-font-accented-dutch-ij
#
#   Followed by Éé, acute is a shortcut to Ãã for Portuguese with spatial
#   mnemonics on AZERTY, where A is close to É.
#
#   Followed by Àà, acute is a shortcut to Õõ for Portuguese with spatial
#   mnemonics on AZERTY, where O is close to À.
#
#   Followed by comma, dead_acute provides an additional input method for
#   "ʻ" U02BB MODIFIER LETTER TURNED COMMA, like dead_circumflex does for
#   "ʼ" U02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE.
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#   This imposes a restriction on the virtual cedilla and acute dead key.
#   See # # CEDILLA&ACUTE
#
#   The acute accent below virtual dead key is removed as designed to foster
#   a better quotation mark input method. The only two acute below characters
#   are now with ampersand for "̗" U0317 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT BELOW, and
#   with underscore for "ˏ" U02CF MODIFIER LETTER LOW ACUTE ACCENT.

#   As a diacritic, the double ring is used, as coming closest to a curl below.
#   Since the combining double ring below has no spacing clone nor any modifier
#   looking close to it, the centered half rings "˒" U02D2, "˓" U02D3 are used
#   instead, with a rationale based on the laterality of the AltFr and AltGr
#   modifier keys involved in typing these left and right half rings this way.

#   These word boundary preventing characters, needed in Breton and Polynesian

# # Oslash for Danish, Norwegian and other languages
#
#   While ISO layouts have Øø in group 1 of Oo, and Œœ in group 1 of Ee, for
#   intuitivity and predictability both letters Ææ and Œœ are in group 1 of Aa
#   and Oo in this layout, leaving no room for Oslash.
#
#   Oslash has normal support in dead_stroke, but as a convenience for Danish
#   and other languages, Oslash is in group 1 of Ccedilla and Odiaeresis.
#   On AZERTY, Ccedilla is above the O key, while Swiss QWERTZ has also an
#   Odiaeresis live key. In an effort to mitigate the inconvenience of not
#   having Øø in group 1 of Oo, Oslash is additionally in dead_diaeresis,
#   with Ccedilla as a base character again, and good mnemonics since Danish Øø
#   is phonetically equivalent to Swedish Öö.

# # HORIZONTAL BAR and NON-BREAKING HYPHEN for African, Breton and Polynesian
#
#   Two positions on key E08 are used for Ɔɔ U0186, U0254 or Ññ U00D1, U00F1,
#   or the macron dead key and the ʻeta "ʻ" U02BB MODIFIER LETTER TURNED COMMA.
#
#   To work around the loss of the key position where the HORIZONTAL BAR dash
#   is mapped, this is in group 1 of case insensitive OPEN O and N WITH TILDE
#   mapped on that key in African and Breton variants respectively. Given that
#   the default mapping of the HORIZONTAL BAR is on shifted E08, the Polynesian
#   variants use U02BB as a base character for HORIZONTAL BAR, while unshifted
#   key E08 or E07 yields the NON-BREAKING HYPHEN based on the macron dead key.
#
#   HORIZONTAL BAR is also in group 1 of underscore, but regional and remapped
#   variants have this running only on level 3.
#   See # # C09
#
#   The HORIZONTAL BAR Unicode informative alias is “quotation dash”. No doubt
#   the Cambria font makes the most sense of it, giving it a three-quarter em
#   length and making it a four-per-three-em dash. Other fonts use this dash
#   to have a conjoining em dash, where em dash is not.

# # HORIZONTAL BAR for remapped variants
#
#   Given that in ASCII mode, the underscore is on unshifted key D12, remapped
#   variants use the underscore’s remapped key position on unshifted E07 to get
#   an unshifted position for the non-breaking hyphen, and E06 is dedicated to
#   casing Ùù for consistency even though uppercase support by Caps Lock would
#   be sufficient. As a consequence, in French mode underscore has no unshifted
#   key support. To keep running the input method of HORIZONTAL BAR in group 1
#   of underscore, non-breaking hyphen works as a base character too.

# # Tabular minus sign
#
#   The FIGURE DASH is a tabular minus sign used in typesetting tables, not in
#   interval notation, although it was recommended for that purpose.
#   https://web.archive.org/web/20210224183416/http://www.technicalauthoring.com/wiki/index.php/Figure_dash
#
#   Since FIGURE DASH occurs in single instances only, it is compatible with
#   dead key input, unlike FIGURE SPACE and PUNCTUATION SPACE that are the
#   tabular digit and punctuation spaces, respectively, and are mapped on live
#   keys B07 (digitspace) and B08 (punctspace), level 7, in ASCII mode.
#
#   However, FIGURE DASH is also mapped on live key D05 (figdash), level 6
#   (Shift + AltFr + T), where MINUS SIGN is on level 5 (AltFr).

# # Arrows as on the numpad
#
#   These are needed to palliate a lack of the dedicated or integrated numpad.
#
#   Five sets of arrows and ten arrow emoji have an input method using digits
#   0..9 in groups 2..7. The digits are based on the position of cursor arrows
#   on the numpad on keys 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8. The remaining single headed arrows
#   are extrapolated; double-headed left-right is placed on 5, up-down on 0.
#
#   The arrow emoji are heterogeneous in that the diagonal and bidirectional
#   arrows are basic arrows, whereas the cardinal arrows are picked from the
#   plain arrows. For UX consistency, this mix makes up an extra set.
#
#   Group 1 is not used here, since digits in group 1 are dead keys activating
#   other groups. And groups 8 and 10 are used for mathematical digit symbols:
#   double-struck (U1D7D8..) and sans-serif (U1D7E2..). So groups 9, 11 and 12
#   are used for additional arrow sets: triangle-headed to bar (U2B70..) as of
#   BMP arrows, and the wide-headed light (U1F860..) and very heavy (U1F880..)
#   in the SMP. The sans-serif set U1F850.. is skipped as not providing enough
#   added value with respect to the fact that on most computers (Windows), SMP
#   characters are hard to input inside the TSF using only layout drivers with
#   an inappropriate data type picked for dead key output. 0 and 5 are used to
#   input the high surrogate, since these arrows do not include bidirectionals.
#   The numpad live key level depends on the ModLock toggle state.

#
#   This is 100% backwards compatible with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, except for the
#   double press, used to activate the CURRENCY_EXTENDED dead key, rather than
#   to yield the generic currency sign "¤" U00A4.
#
#   The generic currency sign "¤" U00A4 however is extensively supported, with
#   both the two breaking and the two no-break spaces as base characters, both
#   after single and double press, and by case insensitive <Multi_key><x><o>
#   sequences as backwards compatible Multi_key equivalents.
#   See #^# CURRENCY_EXTENDED
#   See # # Currency symbols
#
#   Letters Jj Qq Vv Xx Zz are unused in en_US.UTF-8/Compose dead_currency,
#   while 9 symbols are left over among support by base letters.
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, the BENGALI RUPEE MARK requires a thorn live key,
#   while the INDIAN RUPEE SIGN is supported only by Multi_key =R sequences.
#   The other seven symbols are unsupported by en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#   New base:
#   J        "৲" U09F2 # BENGALI RUPEE MARK
#   j        "₹" U20B9 # INDIAN RUPEE SIGN
#   Q        "₹" U20B9 # INDIAN RUPEE SIGN alternative
#   q        "֏" U058F # ARMENIAN DRAM SIGN
#   V        "₺" U20BA # TURKISH LIRA SIGN
#   v        "₾" U20BE # LARI SIGN
#   X        "₸" U20B8 # TENGE SIGN
#   x        "₼" U20BC # MANAT SIGN
#   Z        "₽" U20BD # RUBLE SIGN
#   z        "₷" U20B7 # SPESMILO SIGN
#
#   These are also supported in the new double press CURRENCY_EXTENDED,
#   as well as the following:
#
#   "₿" U20BF # BITCOIN SIGN
#   "₶" U20B6 # LIVRE TOURNOIS SIGN
#   "₻" U20BB # NORDIC MARK SIGN
#
#   See #^# CURRENCY_EXTENDED
#
#   These are duplicated on another base letter as well:
#
#   "৲" U09F2 # BENGALI RUPEE MARK
#   "₢" U20A2 # CRUZEIRO SIGN
#   "₵" U20B5 # CEDI SIGN
#   "₱" U20B1 # PESO SIGN
#   "௹" U0BF9 # TAMIL RUPEE SIGN
#
#   "₵" U20B5 # CEDI SIGN has Ccedilla as a base character too, for consistency
#   with en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#   Integral symbols are also supported, based on S mnemonics, with the
#   corresponding digits as base characters. Likewise, contour integrals
#   are also supported, although they are also in dead_abovering.

#   This also supports the new U1DF00 LATIN SMALL LETTER FENG DIGRAPH WITH TRILL
#   because the TRILL looks like two inverted breves or a double inverted breve.
#
#   As inverted breve has only 6×2 precomposed letters, it might be virtualized
#   by dead breve double press, but it has a dead key of its own for consistency
#   with ASCII symbols, and supported by its XKB X11 keysym dead_invertedbreve.
#
#   Inverted breve has no reported usage outside Unicode precomposed letters.
#   https://www.frathwiki.com/Inverted_Breve
#
#   "˓" U02D3 MODIFIER LETTER CENTRED LEFT HALF RING is mapped to unconflicting
#   and case insensitive C, with its right equivalent in dead_breve.
#
#   "͡" U0361 COMBINING DOUBLE INVERTED BREVE is mapped to unconflicting and
#   case insensitive D. Consistently, "᷼" U1DFC in dead_invertedbreve double
#   press, and likewise "͝" U035D and "͜" U035C in dead_breve single and double
#   press.

#
#   The rationale for merging an added BELT dead key with the BREVE dead key is
#   similarity in shape. But it cannot be merged with BREVE because of composed
#   L with combining breve, used in Inng. So dead_breve double press is needed.
#
#   As an easier alternative HORN could be used, but it is not, for the sake of
#   mnemonics and to prevent HORN from becoming a holdall dead key.
#   See #*# HORN
#
#   BELT cannot be merged with hook because of "𝼑" U1DF11, nor curl because of
#   "ȴ" U0234, nor flourish because of "𝼦" U1DF26.
#
#   BELT cannot be merged with retroflex hook because of "ɭ" U026D, nor palatal
#   hook because of "ᶅ" U1D85 and because retroflex hook and palatal hook occur
#   together with belt on "ꞎ" UA78E, "𐞝" U1079D, "𝼓" U1DF13.
#
#   BELT cannot be merged with RING either, because this occurs as middle ring
#   on small l: "ꬹ" UAB39.
#
#   For a spacing clone of the combining breve below, "⏑" U23D1 METRICAL BREVE
#   could be picked on a best-fit basis although it is a symbol, not a letter.
#   Given that breve below and inverted breve below do not have spacing clones,
#   and for a consistent scheme across breve and inverted breve using modifier
#   letters only, not symbols nor punctuation, the top and bottom half o seem a
#   better fit. As these come in a baseline set and a superscript set, both are
#   provided, with the superscript going on the no-break thin space as a base.

#
#   In XKB X11, the diacritic called “stroke” had an ambiguous shape, until the
#   horizontal stroke and the oblique stroke were disambiguated, by introducing
#   the new dead_longsolidusoverlay keysym named after U0338 "̸" COMBINING LONG
#   SOLIDUS OVERLAY as one of four extra dead elements for the German T3 layout
#   designed around 2010 and standardized in 2012 as DIN 2137:2012.
#
#   The use of dead_stroke for horizontal, rather than using it for oblique and
#   introducing *dead_bar/*dead_shortstrokeoverlay to cover horizontal, appears
#   to be fueled by the name of the combining diacritic and the character names
#   containing WITH STROKE with the meaning of WITH BAR, or BARRED like UAB33,
#   or like in the Unicode 1.0 name of U0197: “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER BARRED I”,
#   that Unicode was urged to rename at ISO merger, making it an I WITH STROKE.
#
#   But since dead_longsolidusoverlay was removed in 2023, dead_stroke is used
#   for slash-shaped diacritics again, while missing *dead_bar gets a PUA code.
#   See # # Bar and stroke diacritics
#
#   All barred letters occurring in orthographies have their precomposed form
#   encoded in Unicode, since the overlay bar diacritics do not render well.
#   https://www.frathwiki.com/Bar
#
#   As a spacing counterpart of the short bar diacritic "̵" U0335, "˗" U02D7 is
#   convenient, since it is not the superscript minus sign, despite being named
#   a MODIFIER LETTER.

#   *dead_bar triple press
#   Multi_key: ¦---
#   Dchar: 
#
#   This dead key is required to have an intuitive input method for "Ꝉ" UA748,
#   "ꝉ" UA749, that adds to "Ƚ" U023D, "ƚ" U019A on #dead_bar single press, and
#   "Ⱡ" U2C60, "ⱡ" U2C61 on *dead_bar double press.
#
#   As a diacritic, "͆" U0346 is picked for carrying semantics of horizontality
#   in a high position, but it ends here. The modifier letters are arrowheads,
#   with a rationale based on the laterality of the AltFr and AltGr modifiers
#   involved in typing "˂" U02C2 and "˃" U02C3. To complete the set, "˄" U02C4
#   and "˅" U02C5 are mapped to mnemonic, case insensitive letters A and V.
#   Additionally, along the lines of what is done on dead_caron double press,
#   C, G, W can be used to input "˂" U02C2, and D, M, P, R are for "˃" U02C3.

#   horn or descender or notch

#   Dchar: "ơ" U01A1
#
#   As HORN has no reported usage outside Unicode precomposed letters, HORN is
#   now extended to support the historic letters with DESCENDER as well as the
#   Swedish "ⱸ" U2C78 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH NOTCH. For mnemonics, both may
#   be thought of as a low horn or a downwards horn.

#   https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%B1%B8
#
#   HORN could also be used as an easier alternative for the belt diacritic. It
#   is not, for the sake of mnemonics and to prevent HORN from being a holdall.
#   See #^# BELT, BREVE_BELOW
#
#   Digits yield simple arrows as a redundant facility to meet most common user
#   expectations. Double arrows are yielded by *dead_flag.
#   See #*# FLAG
#
#   Instead of a non-existing spacing clone of "̛" U031B, "˖" U02D6 is picked,
#   based on the horn’s traditional Multi_key equivalent "+", consistently with
#   "˗" U02D7 in the dead key for barred letters *dead_bar.

#   Unlike superscript letters, used as abbreviation indicators in French and
#   other Latin-script-using languages, subscripts do not seem to be used in
#   orthographies of natural languages.
#
#   By lack of preformatted subscript uppercase, the uppercase slots are used
#   for small caps, frequent in phonetics.
#
#   Missing letters are replaced with "∄" U2204 THERE DOES NOT EXIST.
#
#   The associated diacritic and its spacing clone are built on the underscore
#   theme hinted by the subscript’s TeX command: "̲" U0332 and ASCII "_" U005F.

#   Since the combining hook above has no spacing clone nor any modifier letter
#   looking close to it, both half rings "ʾ" U02BE, "ʿ" U02BF are provided as a
#   workaround, with a rationale based on the laterality of the AltFr and AltGr
#   modifier keys involved in typing these left and right half rings this way.
#   AltGr + space yields nobreakspace, and the no-break thin space U202F is on
#   AltFr + space.

#   As the glottal letters new to Unicode v12 are diacriticized with a spiritus
#   lenis, Greek psili, they are here in a dedicated virtual dead key, based on
#   the hook above as looking closest. However, given the psili is considered a
#   comma above, and has been encoded consistently, these letters are also part
#   of the virtual dead key based on dead_belowcomma double press with a set of
#   duplicates in dead_belowcomma for convenience.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_breathing
#
#   As a diacritic, a mark looking close to a right half ring is picked, for an
#   alternative to the comma above: "҆" U0486, although this is Cyrillic. But a
#   dedicated spacing clone is available for Greek smooth breathing: "᾿" U1FBF.

#   This is required for the letters used with a real line below, rather than a
#   macron below. But there are no precomposed letters with line below. Names
#   built on "WITH LINE BELOW" refer to a macron below instead.

#   The associated diacritic and its spacing equivalent are the same as for the
#   subscript dead key, here because of the diacritic, there due to the spacing
#   character, that is the plain ASCII underscore. Neither can be replaced with
#   a valid alternative. So, we have a pair of duplicates across two dead keys.

#
#   In XKB X11, the diacritic called “stroke” had an ambiguous shape, until the
#   horizontal stroke and the oblique stroke were disambiguated, by introducing
#   the new dead_longsolidusoverlay keysym named after U0338 "̸" COMBINING LONG
#   SOLIDUS OVERLAY as one of four extra dead elements for the German T3 layout
#   designed around 2010 and standardized in 2012 as DIN 2137:2012.
#
#   The use of dead_stroke for horizontal, rather than using it for oblique and
#   introducing *dead_bar/*dead_shortstrokeoverlay to cover horizontal, appears
#   to be fueled by the name of the combining diacritic and the character names
#   containing WITH STROKE with the meaning of WITH BAR, or BARRED like UAB33,
#   or like in the Unicode 1.0 name of U0197: “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER BARRED I”,
#   that Unicode renamed to its ISO name “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH STROKE”.
#
#   But since dead_longsolidusoverlay was removed in 2023, dead_stroke is used
#   for slash-shaped diacritics again.
#   See # # Bar and stroke diacritics
#
#   For convenience, to account for this confusion, letters without a variant
#   with stroke have their barred variant duplicated in this dead key as well.
#
#   Negated mathematical symbols are also supported by ACUTE, which acts as a
#   quick access unless a quick access sequence conflicts with regular support.
#   See #*# ACUTE
#
#   Digits yield mathematical slashes without space termination.
#   See # # Design of math sequences
#   See #*# REVERSED
#
#   As a spacing counterpart of the long solidus diacritic "̸" U0338, "ꜘ" UA718
#   is picked rather than a slash punctuation or symbol, with respect to double
#   and triple press virtual dead keys also needing a spacing equivalent, so as
#   to get a consistent set: "ꜘ" UA718, "ꜗ" UA717, "ꜙ" UA719.

#   This is required because we have both "Ꞣ" UA7A2 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER K WITH
#   OBLIQUE STROKE and "Ꝃ" UA742 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER K WITH DIAGONAL STROKE.
#   Among the 3 other letters with diagonal stroke, "Ꝙ" UA758 "ꝙ" UA759 has the
#   stroke through the descender, while "Ⱦ" U023E "ⱦ" U2C66 has the stroke from
#   lower left to upper right, and "Ꝟ" UA75E "ꝟ" UA75F has it from there to the
#   top. Consistently, "Ꝙ" UA758 "ꝙ" UA759 is duplicated here, and the dead key
#   is called SHORT_STROKE rather than DIAGONAL_STROKE, while the other two are
#   unconflictingly supported in dead_stroke single press.
#
#   As of a spacing modifier letter, "ꜗ" UA717 is picked, consistently with "ꜘ"
#   UA718 MODIFIER LETTER DOT SLASH that fills this slot in single press.

#   Multi_key: ¦<
#   Dchar: "ê" U00EA
#
#   Followed by quotedbl, apostrophe or rightsinglequotemark, dead_circumflex
#   yields turned high curly quotation marks U2018, U201C (opening or closing).
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   The polygrams -êk-, -êl-, -êm-, -ên-, -êp-, -êq-, -êr-, -êt-, -êv-, -êch-
#   make dead_circumflex behave like an Ê key in most cases by using the fact
#   that the letters k, l, m, n, p, q, r, t, v, x do not exist as precomposed
#   letters with circumflex accent, and most of these are not in usage either
#   with combining circumflex as known composed letters. Those that are, will
#   need to be overridden, so as to prioritize the Ê key emulation sequences.
#   French usage information: Courtesy _La fée des lettres_.
#   https://www.motsavec.com
#
#   The following are the sequences included despite being overridden:
#   <dead_circumflex><M> : "M̂" # U004D U0302 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER M WITH CIRCUMFLEX: Min Nan
#   <dead_circumflex><m> : "m̂" # U006D U0302 LATIN SMALL LETTER M WITH CIRCUMFLEX: Min Nan
#   <dead_circumflex><N> : "N̂" # U004E U0302 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N WITH CIRCUMFLEX: Min Nan
#   <dead_circumflex><n> : "n̂" # U006E U0302 LATIN SMALL LETTER N WITH CIRCUMFLEX: Min Nan
#   Courtesy https://www.frathwiki.com/Circumflex
#
#   Cross-platform compatibility is full on MacOS, but only partial on Windows.
#   Windows is able to support only lowercase, and only digrams — provided that
#   the dead key is assigned the appropriate dead character. For the circumflex
#   accent dead key, that is U00EA "ê" LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX.
#
#   Likewise, a Ç key is emulated for use on the Canadian French variant.
#   See #*# CEDILLA
#
#   The circumflex dead key is also expected to support superscript digits, for
#   the sake of conformance with NF Z71-300:2019, section 6.3.3 page 24, and as
#   a tribute to the German E DIN 2137-1:2020-11 that has been synced, but only
#   with the digits part, not the signs and parentheses.
#   https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_2137#%C3%9Cberarbeitung_2020
#
#   But the Multi_key equivalent of this way to input superscript digits cannot
#   be supported, since it conflicts with "❤" U2764 as of "³" U00B3, and as of
#   "⁸" U2078, with a new sequence introduced for the less frequent "♥" U2665.
#   See #   Heart emoji
#
#   So the set of remaining numeric base characters is engaged for bullets as a
#   useful functionality after support for bullets was disrupted in the symbols
#   groups. Now a set of 8 bullets is supported: "•" U2022, "◦" U25E6,
#   "▪" U25AA, "▫" U25AB, "‣" U2023, "▹" U25B9, "➢" U27A2, "➣" U27A3.
#
#   Previously, the heart emoji logic was followed through, supporting the full
#   set of filled (emoji "♥" U2665, "♣" U2663, "♦" U2666, "♠" U2660) and
#   outlined (non-emoji "♡" U2661, "♧" U2667, "♢" U2662, "♤" U2664) suits.
#   See # # B07-level1
#   See # # CIRCUMFLEX&GROUP_2
#   See # # Miscellaneous Symbols in block U2600 used in mathematics
#
#   The diaeresis dead key offers an acceptable alternative with good mnemonics
#   using the traditional mapping on the same key in shift position.
#   See #*# DIAERESIS
#
#   Ultimately, this feature is non-critical since a dedicated superscript dead
#   key is also present, in NF Z71-300:2019 too.
#   See #*# SUPERSCRIPT
#
#   Moreover, superscript and subscript digits are on live keys.
#
#   NOTE: In en_US.UTF-8/Compose that the superscript digits by dead_circumflex
#   feature comes from, the superscript dead key is missing, consistently with
#   the *dead_superscript or equivalent keysym missing in keysymdef.h.
#
#   Followed by Çç, circumflex is a shortcut to Ññ for Breton and Spanish.
#
#   U017F LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S, in group 3 of s, has an additional input
#   method by <dead_circumflex><f> since French has no words including an -êf-.
#   Plus, <dead_circumflex><dollar> also yields the same small letter.
#
#   Likewise, U2300 DIAMETER SIGN, in group 1 of (, is given yet another input
#   method by <dead_circumflex><d>, <dead_circumflex><D> due to the fact that
#   French does not have any word with -êd-.
#
#   U016C LATIN CAPITAL LETTER U WITH BREVE is used in Esperanto and has thus a
#   shortcut by <dead_circumflex><B>, and U016D LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH BREVE
#   may alternatively be input by <dead_circumflex><b>. as French doesn’t have
#   any word with -êb-. Another pair of shortcuts uses Ugrave, since U has not
#   been encoded with circumflex and grave, as opposed to A, E and O.
#
#   Followed by comma, dead_circumflex provides an additional input method for
#   "ʼ" U02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE, consistently with dead_acute for
#   "ʻ" U02BB MODIFIER LETTER TURNED COMMA.
#
#   Followed by asterisk, dead_circumflex provides a shortcut for 
#   "⁂" U2042 ASTERISM, consistently with dead_diaeresis for "⁑" U2051.
#
#   Supporting the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols high surrogate is designed
#   for portability, but on Linux and ChromeOS it is ineffective.

#^# HACEK input facility by CIRCUMFLEX
#   dead_circumflex triple press
#   Multi_key: ¦<<<
#   Dchar: "ȟ" U021F
#
#   For ease of access, and in an attempt to meet potential user expectations,
#   the hacek dead key is also activatable by dead_circumflex triple press,
#   following the logic that multiple dead key presses shift diacritics around
#   and may also turn them. For portability, the full dead key content must be
#   supported, as well as Multi_key, even though this does not make sense.
#
#   While the most streamlined implementation would be by adding the triple
#   dead_circumflex sequences right in the HACEK dead key, for consistency
#   the content is copied and maintained separately, since this file is also
#   a documentation source.

#
#   The hacek dead key supports subscript digits, for the sake of conformance
#   with NF Z71-300:2019, 6.3.3 p24, that E DIN 2137-1:2020-11 has been synced
#   with.
#   https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_2137#%C3%9Cberarbeitung_2020
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   However, this redundancy with the subscript dead key is not extended to the
#   signs and parentheses, as the standard does not require these, and because
#   their Multi_key equivalents would conflict with many mathematical symbols.
#   These would need to be disambiguated by leading space, screwing things up.
#
#   For ease of access, and in an attempt to meet potential user expectations,
#   the hacek dead key is also activatable by dead_circumflex triple press,
#   following the logic that multiple dead key presses shift diacritics around
#   and may also turn them. For portability, the full dead key content must be
#   supported, as well as Multi_key, even though this does not make sense.
#
#   While the most streamlined implementation would be by adding the triple
#   dead_circumflex sequences here, for consistency the content is copied and
#   maintained separately, since this file is also a documentation source.
#   See #^# HACEK input facility by CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   Another facility, <dead_grave><dead_acute>, would conflict with "‛" U201B.
#   The reverse would be counter-intuitive as well as pointless in the presence
#   of the triple circumflex alternative, using the most easily hit dead key of
#   AZERTY.

#*# FLAG
#   letter emoji or flag or double
#   *dead_flag UEFD7
#   Multi_key: ¦=
#   Dchar: "⚐" U2690
#
#   In XKB, on single press, letters yield regional indicator symbols with an
#   appended ZWNJ for letter emoji display and writing words.
#
#   The full set of existing flag emoji is supported on double press.
#   See #^# REGIONAL_INDICATOR_SYMBOL_PAIR
#
#   Regional indicator symbols in isolation are supported on triple press.
#   See #^# REGIONAL_INDICATOR_SYMBOL
#
#   Digits yield double arrows as a redundant facility to meet most common user
#   expectations. Single arrows are yielded by dead_horn.
#   See #*# HORN
#
#   Symbols other than "⹀" U2E40 DOUBLE HYPHEN cannot be supported in group 0,
#   due to numerous Multi_key conflicts. (With respect to this, mathematical
#   symbols use <Multi_key><minus><equal>.)
#
#   Mathematical symbols are also supported by DIAERESIS as a shortcut for
#   DOUBLE, unless a quick access sequence conflicts with regular support.
#   See #*# DIAERESIS
#
#
#   Cross-platform compatibility
#
#   Windows supports an extra modifier added on Caps Lock for continuous input,
#   and also for composing flags. As in continuous input, ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
#   should be appended, on Windows Shift would need to be held down for writing
#   words consistently with the uppercase display of letter emoji, but not when
#   inputting flags.
#
#   MacOS supports an iterative dead key for continuous input, on triple press.
#   As XKB has no support for iterative dead keys, the behavior of single press
#   and triple press is swapped, with single press outputting an appended ZWNJ,
#   and triple press outputting regional indicator symbol letters in isolation.
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, sequences starting with ¦= conflict with currency
#   symbols and with double acute, given that en_US.UTF-8/Compose uses ¦", not
#   ¦:, for diaeresis, and so cannot use ¦" for <dead_doubleacute>, so it uses
#   ¦= instead. Removing currency symbol sequences starting with EQUALS SIGN,
#   leaving only those ending with EQUALS SIGN, solves this issue.
#   See # # Currency symbols
#
#
#   Auxiliary characters
#
#   Auxiliary characters are supported with base characters in synergy:
#   The Multi_key equivalents are impractical, but full ASCII equivalents
#   would conflict with mathematical symbols.
#
#   *  ZWNJ is used to prevent an ISO code letter pair from being displayed
#      as a flag;
#   *  WJ is used to prevent an RI character from breaking off a character of
#      another class;
#   *  Supporting the high surrogate is designed for portability, but on Linux
#      and ChromeOS it is ineffective.
#
#
#   Head character
#
#   For iconicity, the sequences with spaces that yield combining diacritics on
#   most deadkeys, output a white flag, like dead_currency outputs ¤, since the
#   flag used as a base character for subdivision flags is in the SMP:
#   "🏴" U1F3F4 WAVING BLACK FLAG
#   Nevertheless, for completeness, this waving black flag is output when using
#   backslash as a base character.
#
#   Likewise, the sequences with nobreak space and nobreak thin space, used for
#   spacing diacritics on most deadkeys, output the matching black flag.

#   Multi_key: ¦:

#
#   Followed by quotedbl, apostrophe or rightsinglequotemark, dead_diaeresis
#   yields low, opening, curly quotation marks U201A, U201E.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   Diaeresis also supports long dashes, with base characters on the upper row,
#   Shift level, which makes sense because dead_diaeresis is on the base level
#   of E05. Other facilities are available using Multi_key.
#   See # # Dashes and hyphens
#   See # # Long dashes
#
#   For intuitivity, with asterisk as a base character it yields "⁑" U2051,
#   consistently with dead_circumflex for "⁂" U2042 ASTERISM.
#
#   Two less expected yet heavily used symbols, "‖" U2016 DOUBLE VERTICAL LINE
#   and "¦" U00A6 BROKEN BAR repurposed as Multi_key symbol, have quick access
#   by dead_diaeresis followed by slash, or backslash respectively (not bar,
#   due to conflicts with the diaeresis and macron virtual dead keys).
#   See # # DIAERESIS&MACRON
#   See # # MACRON&DIAERESIS
#
#   "¦" U00A6 is also in group 12 of |.
#   See # # C10
#
#   Superscript digits, formerly in dead_circumflex, are also supported for the
#   sake of NF Z71-300:2019. However, this redundancy with the superscript dead
#   key is not extended to the signs and parentheses since NF Z71-300:2019 does
#   not require these, and their Multi_key equivalents would conflict with many
#   mathematical symbols. that would need to be disambiguated by leading space.
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   With diacriticized base letters, dead_diaeresis yields "Ǜ" U01DB, "ǜ" U01DC
#   but also "Ø" U00D8, "ø" U00F8 for convenience.
#   See # # Oslash for Danish, Norwegian and other languages
#
#   Also used as a synonym of EQUAL in mathematical symbols, except for those
#   of these quick access sequences that conflict with regular support.
#   So, "⊆" U2286, "≥" U2265, "≤" U2264 by dead_diaeresis grave, less, greater
#   have been discarded.
#   See #*# FLAG
#
#   Supporting the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols high surrogate is designed
#   for portability, but on Linux and ChromeOS, this is ineffective.

### Group selector introduction
#
#   The private use character UEFB0 is used as the group selector dead key.
#   As a special dead key, the group selector deserves particular attention.
#   Digits and non-ASCII base characters are remaining in the common section.
#   E.g. group 1 of Ɔɔ, Ññ and non-breaking hyphen outputs "―" U2015. That is
#   designed for African, Breton, and remapped variants.
#   See #*# GROUP_1
#
#
# # History
#
#   The group selector dead key has been introduced by Karl Pentzlin while
#   implementing DIN 2137-2:2012 on Windows. Virtual dead keys accessed by
#   multiple dead key presses have been introduced by the French ergonomic
#   bépo keyboard layout project in 2015 while upgrading to version 1.1 for
#   the NF Z71-300:2019 standard.
#
#   *dead_group is used when levels are exhausted by Level5 modifier and toggle.
#   XKB supports the ISO/IEC 9995 conformant group selection since 2013, see
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60991
#   But its keysym mapping array is limited to a maximum number of 8 elements,
#   used up by the extra graphic modifier key required to support input methods
#   for the standard digital representation of numbers and measurement units
#   according to the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures BIPM, and of
#   French text using U202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE to space out big punctuation
#   marks following the French Imprimerie Nationale and/or French new-school
#   typesetting. French new school punctuation mark spacing is documented in
#   points (2) and (3) in:
#   https://forums.macg.co/threads/typo-caracteres-capitales-accentues.25739/page-5#post-3151119
#
#
# # Numbering
#
#   CAUTION: Unlike specified in ISO/IEC 9995, group numbers are zero based.
#   For UX consistency, the default group is group 0. Only groups accessed by
#   the group selector dead key are numbered starting with 1, because a group
#   accessed by an n-uple press on the group selector must be called “group n”,
#   not “group n+1”. The ISO/IEC 9995 standard uses 1-based numbering because
#   it uses the terms “primary” and “secondary” with respect to groups, and it
#   does not consider dead key based group selection with multiple presses.
#
#   As a short identifier for “group #”, “g#” is proposed.
#
#
# # Cross-platform compatibility
#
#   Implementing the group selector as a dead key avoids breaking UX across
#   platforms, as Windows supports 6 + 1 modifiers but unsupports the ISO group
#   selector combo Shift + AltGr, and Apple has broken its technote TN2056 as
#   of around 2015 after previously allowing to use left Option as an extra
#   modifier, used by the German Neo ergonomic keyboard layout later emulating
#   left Option using the Karabiner Elements software from Takayama Fumihiko.
#
#
# # Maintenance
#
#   Filling empty slots with null output "" U0000 can be avoided. The "" U0000
#   strings have been removed for ease of maintenance on 2023-01-13T1356+0100.
#   See # # Notes for maintenance
#
#
#
### Space and symbol groups
#
#   The base characters in this section are mapped on AltGr/Option or unshifted
#   keys as of comma, period and space. Symbols and punctuation mapped on level
#   three assume using the group selector in synergy on AltGr/Option.
#
#   Consistently this section is ordered by keys rather than by code points, as
#   the order of the ASCII symbols on the keyboard layout is used for mnemonics
#   in synergy with the learning curve required by using the base alphabet as a
#   means to remember the symbols.
#
#
# # Emoji
#
#   Supporting all emoji in the Basic Multilingual Plane except Chinese letter
#   emoji makes sense because input by dead keys is cross-platform compatible.
#
#   A number of BMP emoji are supported alternatively or only elsewhere:
#
#       * See # # Legal symbols
#       * See # # Western zodiacal signs emoji
#       * See # # Emoji
#       * See #   Arrow emoji
#
#   A number of Supplemental Multilingual Plane emoji are mapped on live keys.
#
#   The two emoji-related variation selectors are in group 10 on key E, D03,
#   for emoji style, VS16 UFE0F, and on key T, D05, for text style, VS15 UFE0E.
#
#   The five emoji skin tone modifiers based on the 6-shades Fitzpatrick scale
#   are in group 10 on D06..D10.

#   The "ª" U00AA FEMININE ORDINAL INDICATOR is a legacy character, superseded
#   by the use of preformatted superscript small letters for ordinal indicators
#   in Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, also supporting plural forms. The old
#   ordinal indicators are supported by Multi_key and in group 12.
#   See # # D09

#   In Unicode CLDR, "‌" U200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER is the cursive non-joiner.

#   By giving the new name, CLDR intends to improve familiarity, as opposed to
#   names based on “ZERO WIDTH”.

#   The first three positions are inaccessible by Multi_key equivalents, due
#   to an inavoidable interference of numbersign with itself. Hence the symbols
#   in these positions, for instance the ballot box and its 2 filled-in clones,
#   are duplicated after the emoji. Other squares are available elsewhere, too.

#   The arrows in groups 1 and 2 have alphabetic mnemonics in French, where
#   an “arrow” is a “flèche”. This is consistent with DIN 2137 since the 2023
#   revision switched arrows on U and P keys for the right-pointing to be on
#   “P wie Pfeil”, “arrow” in German.

#   Unlike U2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN, in group 1 of U003D, U2010 HYPHEN is not
#   in group 1 of U002D, because it is a duplicate of U002D with the potential
#   of messing up keyboard layouts and user experience when it is too easily
#   accessible.
#   See # # B05
#   See # # Dashes and hyphens
#
#   Instead, U2212 MINUS SIGN is mapped here with respect to incomplete layouts
#   lacking arithmetic base operators, usually on level 5 live key positions.

#   "+" U002B PLUS SIGN is mapped here in group 3, for completeness, given that
#   this is the only ASCII base operator used as such in good typesetting. Also
#   because U2010 in the same group on the previous key is a duplicate of U002D
#   with the potential of messing up keyboard layouts and user experience.

#   With respect to mathematical symbols that need to be negated, the positions
#   in groups 1 to 3 are used for "∣" U2223 DIVIDES, negated as "∤" U2224, then
#   "‖" U2016 DOUBLE VERTICAL LINE for the “double” mnemonics, as well as for
#   "∥" U2225 PARALLEL TO (negated "∦" U2226) to prevent any accessibility bias
#   fostering misuse of "‖" U2016 as "∥" U2225, rather than for single, double
#   and triple daggers, more extensively supported together with their left or
#   right guard or turned counterparts in tilde followed by digits 1 through 6.
#   They would be in groups 1 through 3 of asciitilde for the sake of mnemonics
#   but should not oust those three tilde-based operators either.

#   "µ" U00B5 MICRO SIGN is usually on live keys (key M for mnemonics, key F as
#   an easier alternative, key C12 for hardware compatibility). Its presence in
#   group 11 is designed only as a fallback, for incomplete layouts as required
#   to cope with the malware simulator shipped with Windows.
#
#   "¦" U00A6 BROKEN BAR repurposed as Multi_key symbol is in group 12 although
#   it is more easily input through dead_diaeresis followed by backslash.

#   Polynesian ʻeta, Hawaiʻian ʻokina "ʻ" U02BB is here in group 1 of grave for
#   intuitivity, but it is input as easily by dead_acute or dead_grave followed
#   by comma.

#   See #*# ACUTE
#   See # # CEDILLA&ACUTE

#   Alongside, letter apostrophe "ʼ" U02BC, that does have its place in group 1
#   of apostrophe, may also be input by dead_circumflex followed by comma, with
#   the benefit of ensuring a balanced and undiscriminatory distribution.

#   Frequency requires the two hearts to be in the topmost groups, with U2764
#   HEAVY BLACK HEART (red heart) in group 1 for being the most-used emoji in
#   France, U2665 BLACK HEART SUIT emoji in group 2 as the 14th-ranking emoji,
#   and the other suits U2663, U2666 and U2660 in groups 3 through 5.
#
#   This order disrupts the traditional English alphabetical order. Getting
#   some mnemonics into the resulting list requires to assign CLUB to group 3,
#   DIAMOND to group 4, and (highest-ranking) SPADE to group 5 accordingly.
#
#   The outlined counterparts (no emoji) are supported in groups 2 through 5 of
#   dead_circumflex.

#   This is only a small subset of the many vertically centered dots in Unicode
#   as discussed in:
#   https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/19180/which-dot-character-to-use-in-which-context
#   Notably in this answer from Davislor:
#   https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/470824
#
#   "·" U00B7 MIDDLE DOT is also more conveniently in group 1 of p and P.
#   "⋅" U22C5 DOT OPERATOR is also more conveniently in group 1 of colon.

#   The (full) triangular colon is about 40 times more frequent than its half.
#   Consistently, "ː" U02D0 is in group 1, "ˑ" U02D1 in group 2. For mnemonics,
#   rather than the number of triangles, the 1/1 vs 1/2 logic is convenient.

#   The preferred name and abbreviation of U2009 are NARROW SPACE, NSP.
#   An alternate, more intuitive acronym of U200B is WNJ (WORD NON-JOINER).
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/c7e39f13da2bfbaf58c1447d610627511c7a6549/tools/cldr-code/src/main/java/org/unicode/cldr/util/CodePointEscaper.java#L27
#   For consistency, WNJ is used in documentation rather than ZWSP.
#
#   The French name of U200B is CÉSURE CONDITIONNELLE, break opportunity.
#
#   For ease of input, U2002 and U2003 are on level 1, although they were
#   originally intended to be no-break. That brings the need to put their
#   breaking clones on level3, since they are now canonically equivalent.
#   U2002..U2006 and U2008..U200A were originally intended to be no-break
#   just like U2007 FIGURE SPACE.
#
#   Unlike stated in UAX #14, U2007 is not intended for use *in* figures,
#   but *before* figures for indentation in tables. Therefore, it is also
#   called tabular digit space, as opposed to tabular punctuation space.

#
#   U205F MEDIUM MATHEMATICAL SPACE is a breaking 4/18 em, or 4½-per-em.
#
#   U3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE does not hang into the margin.

### Letter groups
#
#   These groups contain mainly letters and mathematical letter symbols, but
#   some groups also contain mathematical digit symbols.
#
#   In this section, group headings are prefixed with `#+# `.
#
#   On the alphabet, the groups yield mainly:
#
#   Group  0  (g0): live keys (default, no group selected);
#   Group  1  (g1): group selector pressed once: Latin;
#   Group  2  (g2): group selector pressed twice: Latin;
#   Group  3  (g3): group selector pressed thrice or followed by digit 3: Latin;
#   Group  4  (g4): group selector pressed 4 times or followed by digit 4: Latin;
#   Group  5  (g5): group selector then digit 5: Latin;
#   Group  6  (g6): group selector then digit 6: Greek and Greek math symbols;
#   Group  7  (g7): group selector then digit 7: Latin script style math symbols;
#   Group  8  (g8): group selector then digit 8: Latin doublestruck/bold/italic math symbols;
#   Group  9  (g9): group selector then digit 9: Latin fraktur/monospace math symbols;
#   Group 10 (g10): group selector then digit 0: Latin sans-serif math symbols;
#   Group 11 (g11): group selector then digit 1: Latin;
#   Group 12 (g12): group selector then digit 2: Latin.

#+# GROUP_6
#   Group 6 on the base alphabet: Greek letters
#
#   This group, using the mnemonics of the Greek dead key in column 6, letter Y
#   or Greek i (i grec in French), is an alternative Greek letter input method.
#   It may be used where the Greek letter dead key is missing.
#
#   The Greek letter dead key is present on several layouts and it is supported
#   by XKB thanks to the French ergonomic BÉPO keyboard layout https://bepo.fr.
