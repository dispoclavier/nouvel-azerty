#   * In Unicode CLDR, this platform is labeled ChromeOS, and it is explained that
#     in the CLDR, *Linux* is supported alongside *ChromeOS*, or through ChromeOS.
#
#               Installation: On a shared computer please opt for method C.
#                             If other keyboard layouts are used alongside, please apply method A.
#                             Method B requires the least compile time when opening applications.
#                             Including this file in another file in X11/locale/ does not work.
#                             Prepending rather than appending does not work because U1E7A and U1E7B
#                             need to override U01D5 and U01D6. Likewise, "V́" and "v́" need to override
#                             U01D7 and U01D8 as defined in en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#                             Please make sure to be using the full-length file `Compose.yml`.
#
#                             A. 1. Back up the file /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#                                2. Append `Compose.yml` to /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#                             B. 1. Back up the file /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
#                                2. Replace /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose with `Compose.yml`.
#                             C. 1. Back up the file ~/.XCompose if it exists.
#                                2. Append `Compose.yml` to ~/.XCompose or rename it accordingly.
#                                3. Optionally uncomment the following line:
#                                       include "%L"
#                                   That is not mandatory since this file is designed to be standalone.
#                                   That will include the default, en_US.UTF-8/Compose for fr_FR.
#                             The change takes effect in any application after reopening it.
#
#             Uninstallation: A. Restore the previously backed-up original Compose file.
#                             B. Remove this addition from the current Compose file.
#
#                    Setting: The input method needs to be XIM in order for the spaced-out punctuation
#                             to work, e.g. " ?" rather than "". The setting is located in

### Output strings for live keys
#
#   Unlike Windows, XCompose is able to output >1 code units by dead keys.
#   It also handles the output of strings after a single live key press,
#       https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ComposeKey#Compose_key
#       https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/man5/Compose.5.html
#       https://wiki.debian.org/XCompose
#   provided that the X Input Method is active.
#       https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xkeyboard-config/+bug/1584314/comments/6
#       http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man8/im-config.8.html
#       https://askubuntu.com/questions/129680/how-can-i-make-ibus-not-ignore-xcompose
#
#   In XCompose, a single keysym hapax is processed for direct output, whereas a keysym
#   followed by another keysym in >0 instances is considered a dead key throughout, and
#   its singleton output is discarded, thus the system “eats” the dead key press if the
#   input sequence is undefined.
#
#   Definition format in XCompose files:
#   * Single character output may be defined like in allocation tables,
#     but this format is reportedly not interoperable across XKB.
#   * Strings must be defined as literals delimited by double quotes.
#     This is the interoperable format for single character output.
#   Both formats may be used concurrently.
#
#   Definition format in allocation tables (Symbols directory):
#   Single character output in any UCS plane may be defined in:
#   * Uxxxx[x[x]] hex format;
#   * U00xxxxxx hex format;
#   * 0x01xxxxxx hex format.
#   The specified format "\0x123A" does *not* work, neither with nor without quotes,
#   with nor without backslash. Therefore the following specification is not reliable:
#   https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.html
#
#   These layouts make extensive use of added keysyms as in keysymdef.h:97.
#   https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/keysymdef.h

#
# # Breton polygraphs
#
#   The Breton polygraphs are mapped as such on the CʼHWERTY keyboard following
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19506.
#
#   Following the link chain from the documentation of the CʼHWERTY keyboard:
#   http://www.drouizig.org/index.php/br/binviou-br/klavier-c-hwerty-ha-sturiou/162-faq-foire-aux-questions
#   https://dominiko.livejournal.com/22848.html
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25349
#
#   The Breton trigraph has a dedicated key on the Breton variant "kbbrFRs" and
#   it is supported on Shift + AltFr + A on the French base layout "kbfrFRs".
#
#   The Breton trigraph uses regular letter apostrophe U02BC.
#   See Breton exemplar characters in CLDR as pointed in:
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19506#c16.
#   CLDR versions below v34 are too incomplete:
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/release-34/common/main/br.xml#L1164
#
#   These have got mnemonic keysyms in keysymdef.h but may not be supported yet,
#   so they are defined here using "ʼ" U02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE:
#
<c_h> : "cʼh"
<C_h> : "Cʼh"
<C_H> : "CʼH"
#
#
#   The Breton digraph is mapped on the CʼHWERTY keyboard.
#   Therefore, in XKB, it has got three keysyms, too.
#
#   Unlike the trigraph, the digraph has no dedicated support on any variant.
#   It is expected to be input like all polygraphs, as used in many languages.

#
# # Automated punctuation spacing for fr-FR, regular with NNBSP U202F
#
#   Imprimerie nationale (France) assumes that big punctuation is spaced out using either
#   of these spaces:
#
#       * No-break justifying space, behaving like Unicode’s NBSP U00A0;
#       * No-break thin space, behaving like Unicode’s NNBSP U202F.
#
#   Functionally, NNBSP is a no-break clone of Unicode’s thin space THSP U2009.
#
#   The preferred name and abbreviation of U2009 are NARROW SPACE, NSP.
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/tools/cldr-code/src/main/java/org/unicode/cldr/util/CodePointEscaper.java
#
#   This is regular typesetting at Imprimerie nationale except for colon and quotation marks,
#   although the latter are typeset with NNBSP in the Imprimerie nationale style guide
#   (_Lexique des règles en usage à l’Imprimerie nationale_, Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 2002);
#   only the verbatim rule on page 149 disagrees.
#   In mainstream high-quality publishing (new school), NNBSP is used throughout.
#
#   See Philippe Verdy’s testimony in:
#   http://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2015-m06/0220.html
#
#   The Unicode position is found in  UAX #14 since 2007, and in TUS since 2014:
#   The Unicode Standard, version 7.0.0, 2014, p. 265, chapter 6, section 6.2,
#   heading “Space Characters”, subheading “Narrow No-Break Space”:
#
#      The NNBSP can be used to represent the narrow space occurring around punctuation
#      characters in French typography, which is called an “espace fine insécable.”
#
#   The Unicode position reflects also in the following document:
#   Recommendations to UTC #160 July 2019 on Script Proposals — Script Ad Hoc group
#   http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19286-script-recs.pdf
#   Page 14 (last page) states:
#
#      The Unicode Standard includes several different space characters.
#      It is acceptable to use THIN SPACE, and then use a higher-level protocol,
#      a word joiner, or tailored line-breaking to prevent line-breaking.
#      Alternatively, NNBSP can be used to force no-break behavior.
#
#   However, higher level protocols and tailoring are inacceptable options when
#   used to achieve the digital representation of natural languages. The Unicode
#   Standard specifies that it is about plain text.
#

#   [1] When typeset in compliance with the Imprimerie nationale style manual,

#       is spaced out using NNBSP.
#   [2] Based on the visual aspect in the current edition of the style manual,
#       Imprimerie nationale, the guillemets are typeset with NNBSP, although
#       the verbatim rule suggests that they be spaced out using NBSP.

#
#   A triple zero key is useful only on the numpad. On the extended numpad, the

#   Note however that in the Lexique des règles en usage à l’Imprimerie nationale, 2002
#   (last edition as per 2017 reprint), angle quotation marks are typeset with a narrow
#   space, which corresponds to NNBSP, not a word space, which would correspond to NBSP.
#
#   Once some “dysfunctional” keyboard layout variants supported some of these.
#   Now none of these are supported anymore.

# # Automated punctuation spacing for fr-FR using U2009 THIN SPACE, U2060 WORD JOINER
#
#   This is an acceptable fallback, given in most fonts NNBSP has the same width as THIN SPACE, and
#   THIN SPACE has line breaking class BA (break after). See the following document:
#   Recommendations to UTC #160 July 2019 on Script Proposals — Script Ad Hoc group
#   http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19286-script-recs.pdf
#   Page 14 (last page) states:
#      The Unicode Standard includes several different space characters. It is acceptable to use THIN
#      SPACE, and then use a higher-level protocol, a word joiner, or tailored line-breaking to prevent
#      line-breaking. Alternatively, NNBSP can be used to force no-break behavior.
#
#   This fallback works everywhere THIN SPACE and WORD JOINER are supported.
#
#   Display: THIN SPACE is represented like SPACE by the Gedit Draw Spaces plugin.

#   This space is *not* SPACE but U2009 THIN SPACE followed by U2060 WORD JOINER.

### Multi_key sequences
#
#   The described behavior of XCompose is based on en_US.UTF-8/Compose,
#   as it is used in France.
#
#   The maximum number of keysyms is nine. Longer sequences are ignored.
#
#
# # Notes on Unicode support
#
#   Due to more comprehensive support for Unicode characters used in Latin
#   script as encoded since version 1.1 of the Standard, some sequences in
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose need to be redefined, by making more extensive use
#   of ASCII symbols and punctuation.
#
#   With the Multi_key thought of as a generic dead key taking arguments,
#   the base letter that those modifications are applied to is typed last.
#   This pattern performs much better, as it empowers XCompose to apply
#   multiple diacritics as used e.g. in Vietnamese and Lithuanian.
#
#   As a result, semantics of paired punctuation may be switched compared to
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose. Examples of Multi_key equivalents for dead_breve:
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose: <Multi_key><a><parenleft>
#   In new-school Compose:  <Multi_key><parenright><a>
#   This scheme is not proper to new school, since in en_US.UTF-8/Compose we
#   already have U-shape:   <Multi_key><U><a>
#   As well as the initial: <Multi_key><b><a>
#
#   While that change alone would not warrant a comprehensive overhaul, more
#   tweaks are required, such as supporting superscript and subscript, using
#   asciicircum and underscore repurposed, formerly circumflex and macron.
#
#   So, when < and > are used for circumflex and hacek or hatchek aka caron,
#   and | for macron, : gets used as the diaeresis symbol like in Vim, while
#   the ASCII double quote looks fine for double acute accent, a change that
#   is the more desirable as it also fixes an issue with sequences for curly
#   quotation marks.
#
#   Bottom line: Full Unicode support requires the upgraded Multi_key scheme.
#
#   The extended Latin F & G blocks are supported since 2023-05-25T1205+0200.
#   https://unicode.org/versions/enumeratedversions.html
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-F
#
#
# # Notes for maintenance
#
#   Most dead key sequences have their Multi_key equivalent added below by
#   `generate-multikey.pl` run by `multikey.sh`.
#
#   The colon alignment in column 90 is based on longest Multi_key sequences,
#   in terms of string length. In VSCode a zoom factor of -0.7 is then needed
#   on 16:10 displays as used for developing this file. At some point despite
#   the max 9 keysym constraint, longer sequences were necessary (e.g. U10789
#   and U107AB; 2023-05-12T2039+0200),

#   pointed in the Unicode NamesList: “used generically for hyphen, minus sign
#   or en dash, all of which have dedicated alternatives”. As a consequence, it
#   should be prevented from fully deploying its adverse effects by taking up a
#   position on keyboard layouts, screwing everything up in the process, from
#   undeliverable email to broken links to parse errors. It may be input using
#   the group selector dead key like double and triple dashes, or the following
#   mnemonic scheme.
#   See # # Hyphen and long dashes
#
#       EM DASH        = (full) dash (called “tiret cadratin” in French)
#       HORIZONTAL BAR = three-quarter-dash in Cambria, or conjoining em dash
#       EN DASH        = half a dash (French “tiret demi-cadratin”)
#       HYPHEN         = quarter-dash (French “tiret quart-de-cadratin”)
#       TWO-EM DASH    = indicates missing letters, or a missing word
#       THREE-EM DASH  = used for a missing word, or author’s name repetition
#

# # Vulgar fractions
#
#   Since the design of this file was changed to become standalone,
#   support for vulgar fractions needed to be reimplemented.
#
#   Consistently with en_US.UTF-8/Compose, 2-digit sequences support the
#   fractions as more frequently used than circled digits, but ⅒ is now
#   <Multi_key><1><1>, not <Multi_key><1><1><0>.
#
#   For a predictable, intuitive, consistent, versatile user experience,
#   sequences with a slash are also supported, and fraction numerator 1,
#   initially <Multi_key><1><slash>, is extended with space accordingly,
#   while its short sequence <Multi_key><1><space> is still supported.
#
#   Freely composed vulgar fractions may use ⁄ U2044 FRACTION SLASH, that
#   triggers autoformatting of base digits to vulgar fractions as stated
#   in the Unicode Standard — on the condition that the rendering engine
#   is actually Unicode conformant, like HarfBuzz (OpenType) in Firefox.
#   See # # Fraction slash
#
#   A workaround for defective renderers is using superscript digits for
#   numerators, and subscript digits for denominators, with the negative
#   kerning around FRACTION SLASH independently of OpenType support. The
#   result is acceptable if super- and subscripts align between baseline
#   and caps height.

# # Bullets
#
#   In keysymdef.h, 15 bullets are supported, but some comments do not match.
#   This supports the keysyms as implemented, adding support for the intended
#   open rectangular bullet, evidently wrong since the output is filled. This
#   literal is removed for demo on systems working without literals; since it
#   outputs an unintended character, it could be downright discarded as well.
#   Japanese tainome and kome are also supported.

# # Currency symbols
#
#   Symbol-letter sequences are required for precomposed diacritics, with

#   is available for currency symbols.
#
#   These are symbols supported by en_US.UTF-8/Compose, including commented-out
#   ones completed on a best-guess basis.
#   But unlike set up in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, <Multi_key><C><bar> is "₵" U20B5.
#   See #*# CURRENCY
#
#   For the generic currency symbol `¤` by composition, X O sequences are used.
#   Reverse sequences conflict with mathematical symbols.

#
# # Design
#
#   For a conflictless support of variable length sequences, space termination
#   is required for math symbols. When things do not work as expected, that is
#   likely due to a conflict with dead key equivalents. To fix these issues, a
#   sequence may start with space, or with no-break space. In default mode the
#   no-break space is in synergy with the Multi_key dead key. In numeric mode,
#   i.e. when ModLock is on, the space character in synergy with Multi_key is
#   the ASCII space.
#
#   Examples with leading space:    "≪" U226A and "≫" U226B.
#   Examples without leading space: "⋘" U22D8 and "⋙" U22D9.
#
#   A double, triple, or quadruple leading [nobreak]space may also be used.
#   Double:    "⧂" U29C2, "⧜" U29DC, "⧸" U29F8, "◽" U25FD, "⤶" U2936;
#   Triple:    "⟋" U27CB and "⟍" U27CD;
#   Quadruple: "⧵" U29F5, "⁄" U2044; also with leading letter or trailing digit.
#
#   To prevent further conflicts with dead key equivalents, negated sequences
#   work the other way around: letters first, slash last, space to terminate,
#   except when required otherwise for disambiguation in partial negation, as
#   in ≇ U2247 vs "≆" U2246. E.g. "∄" U2204, "∅" U2205, "∉" U2209.
#
#
# # Less or equal, greater or equal
#
#   To support both the straight variant "≤" U2264, "≥" U2265, and the slanted
#   variant, sequences with underscore are repurposed, and sequences with minus
#   are introduced since those with equals are needed for "≦" U2266, "≧" U2267.
#   This applies to all symbols with “or equal to” semantics. If the equals is
#   double line, sequences with equals sign are used; if it is single line, the
#   ASCII minus is used; if the equals is slanted, underscore is used, a single
#   underscore for single-line equals, two underscores for double-line equals,
#   e.g. "⪛" U2A9B. See also "⋚" U22DA vs "⪋" U2A8B.
#
#   The slanted variant "⩽" U2A7D and "⩾" U2A7E, preferred in French, is also
#   in group 2 of < and >.
#
#
# # Not sign
#
#   As rightsinglequotemark is on the apostrophe key in French mode, sequences
#   with apostrophe work also with rightsinglequotemark, like sequences with a
#   leading space also work with a leading no-break space.
#
#   The not sign is also in group 5 of backslash on the N key.
#
#   See also "⫬" U2AEC, "⫭" U2AED, and not-math "⌙" U2319.

# # Greek mathematical SMP symbols
#
#   The at sign is used as a modifier in these Multi_key sequences because it
#   is on the same key as dead_greek and is thus its Multi_key equivalent.
#   See #*# GREEK
#
#   There are many more Greek symbols. Some TeX math packages may not support
#   them all, per Will Robertson, Symbols defined by unicode-math (2023-06-21).

#   "⧵" U29F5 REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR: likely duplicate "∖" U2216 SET MINUS with the potential to fool people into decisions causing issues, e.g.
#   “\setminus translated as U+29F5 ⧵ REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR causes problems #409”
#   https://github.com/tudace/tuda_latex_templates/issues/409
#   Fonts, e.g. DejaVu Sans Mono Book, may give them a slight difference in slant.
#   Since "∕" U2215 DIVISION SLASH does not have any *SOLIDUS OPERATOR equivalent, REVERSE SOLIDUS OPERATOR is disambiguated by a quadruple leading space.
#   For convenience these [back]slash symbols are alternatively disambiguated by a trailing digit, for consistency also those with a single leading space.

# # LaTeX codes
#
#   Since the maximum number of keysyms is 9, many LaTeX commands need to be
#   truncated to make working Multi_key sequences out of them, limiting this
#   input method’s usability.
#
#   Most short sequences require space termination for disambiguation. This
#   is also consistent with TeX control words.

### Dead keys
#
#   The X Keyboard Extension does not have dead keys of its own; it relies on XCompose
#   to emulate dead key behavior. Other systems do not have the Multi_key functionality
#   specifically, but they can emulate Multi_key using chained dead keys.
#
#   Input composition implemented by chaining dead keys is more powerful as it supports
#   modularity, whereas XCompose requires listing all supported sequences, verbatim and
#   in extenso. The reason why is that this does not work:
#
#       <dead_circumflex> <dead_circumflex> : dead_belowcircumflex
#   or:
#       <dead_circumflex> <dead_circumflex> : <dead_belowcircumflex>
#   then:
#       <dead_belowcircumflex> <e>          : "ḙ" U1E19 # LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX BELOW
#
#   That however contradicts what X.org specifies at:
#   https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man5/Compose.5.html
#
#       If the string is omitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according to
#       the current locale.
#
#       I.e., if a rule looks like:
#           <dead_grave>     <A> : "\300" Agrave
#       the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.
#       But if the rule is:
#           <dead_grave> <A> : Agrave
#       the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.
#
#
# # Virtual dead keys
#
#   The French BÉPO ergonomic keyboard layout defines additional dead keys virtualized
#   by a double press of a dead key. The diacritic is either doubled or transformed.
#   Mostly it is shifted to the less frequently diacriticized side of the letter.
#   More information is available in French on the bépo website:
#   https://bepo.fr/wiki/Version_1.1rc1/Touches_mortes/Pressions_multiples
#
#   Mostly, virtual dead keys on double press yield the
#   same diacritic shifted below or above the letter in
#   conformance with fr-bépo ergonomic keyboard layout.
#   Double press is a way of chaining dead key presses.
#   Multiple diacritics also require chained dead keys.
#
#
# # X11 dead key syms defined in keysymdef.h
#
#   Dead keys are defined for Latin and Greek keyboards and for other input methods.
#   Some new dead keys already have a keysym defined in keysymdef.h;
#   an update package can be installed with this command:
#
#       sudo apt-get install x11proto-core-dev
#
#   For Latin keyboard layouts — keysyms used in this layout are checked:
#
#      dead_abovecomma
#    ✔ dead_abovedot
#      dead_abovereversedcomma
#    ✔ dead_abovering
#      dead_aboveverticalline
#    ✔ dead_acute
#      dead_belowbreve
#      dead_belowcircumflex
#    ✔ dead_belowcomma
#      dead_belowdiaeresis
#    ✔ dead_belowdot
#      dead_belowmacron
#      dead_belowring
#      dead_belowtilde
#      dead_belowverticalline
#    ✔ dead_breve
#    ✔ dead_caron
#    ✔ dead_cedilla
#    ✔ dead_circumflex
#    ✔ dead_currency
#    ✔ dead_diaeresis
#    ✔ dead_doubleacute
#      dead_doublegrave
#    ✔ dead_grave
#    ✔ dead_greek
#    ✔ dead_hook
#    ✔ dead_horn
#    ✔ dead_invertedbreve
#    ✔ dead_longsolidusoverlay
#      dead_lowline
#    ✔ dead_macron
#    ✔ dead_ogonek
#    ✔ dead_stroke
#    ✔ dead_tilde
#
#   The deadkeysym dead_stroke is newly dedicated to the horizontal dash overlay,
#   aka bar. One dead key is not enough to support both / and - shaped diacritics.
#   Thanks to Karl Pentzlin’s German T3, dead_longsolidusoverlay was added to the
#   keysyms from the name of the diacritic used to decompose negated math symbols:
#
#   ̸ U0338 COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY
#
#   Oslash (U00D8/F8 LATIN CAPITAL/SMALL LETTER O WITH STROKE) is not decomposed.
#
#   Initially it was called dead_longsolidus, and dead_stroke was replaced with
#   dead_shortstroke as well.
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=85370
#
#   The deadkeysyms dead_aboveverticalline and dead_belowverticalline have been
#   added specifically for German T3 (“extra dead elements for German T3 layout”
#   of DIN 2137:2012), along with dead_longsolidusoverlay and dead_lowline.
#
#   Vertical line below, and its alternate representation vertical line above,
#   are used in Yoruba and in other languages.
#
#   Unicode did not encode any precomposed letters with vertical line below,
#   as precomposed letters are legacy. The standard representation in Unicode
#   uses combining diacritics in decomposed normalization forms NFD/NFKD.
#
#       U0329 COMBINING VERTICAL LINE BELOW Yoruba, German dialectology
#       U030D COMBINING VERTICAL LINE ABOVE Marshallese
#       U030E COMBINING DOUBLE VERTICAL LINE ABOVE Marshallese
#
#   The deadkeysym dead_lowline is not used to input precomposed letters having
#   “WITH LINE BELOW” in their name, given in the Latin Extended Additional block,
#   “the names "WITH LINE BELOW" refer to a macron below the letter.”
#   https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_1E00.html
#   These are input using dead_belowmacron, which may be virtualized by double press of
#   dead_macron.
#
#   Keyboard layouts compliant with ISO/IEC 9995-11 still may have that dead key, given
#   they are using combining diacritics as dead characters on Windows, the OS that this
#   part of the standard has been designed for, for instance U0332 COMBINING LOW LINE.
#
#   As the output only consists in an added combining diacritic to any letter typed after,
#   implementing this dead key on non-Windows keyboards needs to know the list of expected
#   output letters. So it does on Windows, as ISO/IEC 9995-11 has no known implementation.
#
#   Note: Although U0332 COMBINING LOW LINE is defined as connecting on left and right,
#   it may not be used to underline a text span in plain text, due to vertical alignment
#   issues under lowercase letters with descender.
#
#
# # Proposed additional dead key syms
#
#   *dead_abovehook (intersection with en_US.UTF-8/Compose dead_hook in Vietnamese Y)
#   *dead_bar as an alias for the ambiguous dead_stroke (horizontal)
#   *dead_circled, virtualized by double press of dead_greek (¦@@)
#   *dead_group: new AZERTY has a dedicated key for this dead key
#   *dead_equal (regional indicator letters, U1F1E6..U1F1FF)
#   *dead_retroflexhook, using brace symmetry to alleviate dead_hook
#   *dead_reversed (~50 Latin letters)
#   *dead_subscript (smallcaps with uppercase base letters)
#   *dead_superscript (modifier letters, abbreviation indicators)
#   *dead_turned (~70); inverted (20) or sideways (8) on double press
#
#
# # Dead keys not included in keysymdef.h
#
#   Some additional dead keys proposed for mapping on an fr-FR keyboard are listed below.
#   The characters defined as output below are the dead characters used on other systems.
#
#   <UEFD0> : "①"   *dead_group, for 12 additional groups (0-based). Multi_key: ¦#
#   <UEFD1> : "^"   *dead_superscript, phonetics / abbreviation indicatrs. Multi_key: ¦^
#                   As abbreviation indicators, superscripts need to be on live keys.
#                   dead_circumflex is not ¦^ but ¦< in new-school Compose.
#   <UEFD2> : "_"   *dead_subscript is required for phonetics as it traditionally
#                   also includes small caps.
#   <UEFD3> : "ẻ"   *dead_abovehook, required for disambiguation with dead_hook. Multi_key: ¦]
#   <UEFD4> : "ɖ"   *dead_retroflexhook, required for disambiguation, consistent with the
#                   new-school Compose scheme: benefits from brace symmetry. Multi_key: ¦}
#   <UEFD5> : "ᴚ"   *dead_turned, technically easiest transform. ~70 instances. Multi_key: ¦%
#                   double-press: inverted (20 instances) or sideways (8 letters) in Latin;
#                   inverted and sideways have an empty intersection. Multi_key: ¦%
#   <UEFD6> : "ᴙ"   *dead_reversed, second-most frequent transform. ~50 (Latin). Multi_key: ¦\
#   <UEFD7> : "⚐"   *dead_equal — The Regional Indicator Symbols dead key. Multi_key: ¦=
#
#
# # Legacy dead keys
#
#   <UEFD8> : "~"   *dead_legacytilde
#   <UEFD9> : "`"   *dead_legacygrave
#
#   Two legacy dead keys are also required for the backward compatible tilde and grave accent
#   dead keys on Shift + AltGr + B02 and B07 respectively. While dead key behavior is updated
#   so as to output the combining diacritic when the space bar is pressed after a dead key, a
#   set of backwards compatible legacy dead keys ensures backwards compatible user experience
#   on these upper-row, level-4 positions designed for a seamless keyboard layout transition.
#   These dead keys have limited functionality, no Multi_key equivalents, and output ASCII on
#   hitting space, and ASCII twice on double press, like it works on Windows.

# # Introducing new-school input composition
#
#   ^ and _ need to be freed up for super- and subscript/smallcaps, by applying
#   the parentheses-breve scheme to circumflex and hacek, macron and diaeresis.
#   For example, new-school Multi_key sequences include ¦^ for superscript,
#   ¦> for hacek, ¦< for circumflex accent, ¦| for macron, ¦: for diaeresis,
#   ¦" for the double acute accent that is an acute diaeresis. That helps avoid
#   collisions with the dead key based input method for apostrophe/comma-shaped
#   double quotation marks. See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   Another reason to adopt new-school is that in en_US.UTF-8/Compose,
#   dead_cedilla’s <comma>, also used for dead_ogonek, conflicts on E.
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose works around this conflict by using <cedilla>,
#   not <comma>, in the Multi_key sequence of U0228, U0229.
#   <semicolon> could be used for both dead_belowcomma and dead_ogonek,
#   but the result would be yet another dead key merger.
#   That is rightfully avoided in en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#
# # Proposed dead key layout for AZERTY keyboards
#
#   30 out of 32 ASCII symbols and punctuation are mapped on level 3 of keys
#   (B..D)(01..10), and 28 dead keys are mapped on level 4 of the same keys
#   as the ASCII characters used to emulate those dead keys by Multi_key as
#   of new-school input composition, designed for full support of the Latin
#   script.
#
#   One of those that is not is dead_abovedot, which is mapped on P, where
#   ampersand is unrelated, but period is mapped on level 5 and used on the
#   extended numpad as a decimal separator, alongside comma on key C10.
#
#   The other exception is dead_cedilla on the comma key, where the question
#   mark on level 3 is not an equivalent of any dead key either.
#
#   So there is multiple easy mnemonics.
#
#   In the Windows implementation of these keyboard layouts, AltGr level 3 is
#   an additional level, 0x10 or Right Oyayubi, without Caps Lock support, but
#   free from the numerous bugs affecting the AltGr level that Windows emulates
#   using Ctrl + Alt. These bugs are fixed on application level, as in MS Word.
#   That is one reason why levels 3 and 4 are not used for casing characters.
#   See Mark Durdin’s article about “Robust key message handling in Windows”:
#   https://blog.keyman.com/2008/06/robust-key-mess/

# # Order of mixed dead keys
#
#   Dead key combinations called chained dead keys on Windows are actionable
#   both ways for two diacritics except when order matters for diacritics to
#   be positioned above, stacked in one order or the other way around, as on
#   U1E7A and U1E7B versus U01D5 and U01D6.
#
#   Diacritic or transformational dead keys applied to letters in groups are
#   to be hit first, before the group selector. That behavior is consistent,
#   it helps streamline code and maintenance, and it makes quick access dead
#   keys described below possible.
#
#
# # Quotation mark input method
#
#   A complete set of curly quotes, input while only hitting unshifted keys, on
#   the condition that both the involved dead keys, and mnemonic, unconflicting
#   base characters have base level mappings.
#
#   This is part of the dead key enhancement based on considering each dead key
#   a group selector activating the "<dead key> group", e.g. "circumflex group"
#   or "dead_circumflex group".

#       Double grave, or diaeresis + grave:    reversed low      U2E42
#
#   The <rightsinglequotemark> base character takes into account that the ASCII
#   apostrophe on row E is replaced with rightsinglequotemark, to enhance UX in
#   French mode, i.e. ModLock off.
#
#   ASCII <apostrophe> is supported alongside for interoperability as designed.
#   Some Multi_key equivalents conflict with CIRCUMFLEX&ACUTE, DIAERESIS&ACUTE.
#   That is fixed by hitting these dead keys the other way around.
#
#   The character descriptors in lowercase are Unicode informative aliases that
#   have been given in case of a suboptimal name.
#
#   Ornamental quotation marks are input by dead key followed by group selector.
#   SMP quotation mark ornaments U1F676.. are not supported, for cross platform
#   compatibility.
#
#
# # Quick access dead keys for groups
#
#   Group 3 quick access dead key is since 2023-04-17T1618+0200
#   the circumflex accent dead key. This replaces an extra dead
#   key in group 1 introduced on 2022-12-26T1503+0100.
#
#   Other quick access dead keys are accute accent for group 4,
#   diaeresis for group 5, grave accent for group 11. These are
#   for letters, not symbols, because that would not make sense
#   and would only be wasteful to code and screw up development
#   and maintenance. So far, quick access is on the base level.
#
#   An additional quick access dead key streamlines group 12, a
#   sequence all on AltGr level: <UEFD0><dead_tilde>.
#
#   See ### Letter groups
#
#
# # Mathematical symbols
#
#   Approximation: See #*# TILDE
#   Negation:      See #*# STROKE
#   Equality:      See #*# EQUAL
#
#   Negated symbols may alternatively be input using (Base-level) dead_acute,
#   since no symbols have been encoded with an acute accent.
#   Mnemonics is based on the slant of the accent.
#
#   Equality symbols may alternatively be input using (Base-level) dead_diaeresis,
#   since no symbols have been encoded with a diaeresis.
#   Mnemonics is based on the double dot and its Multi_key equivalent colon.
#
#
# # Spacing modifier letters and clones of diacritics
#
#   An input method based on overtyping reportedly existed on very old systems.
#   Most of the spacing diacritics in Latin-1 were replaced with actual letters
#   in Latin-15, but other symbols were replaced too while a diacritic remained.
#   The Unicode Standard states in §7.9 that it is not clear whether diacritics
#   were combining or standalone. Using the latter as dead characters (Windows)
#   or terminators (macOS) in dead keys is not possible consistently throughout
#   and is a reason why many keyboard layouts are not streamlined, and dead key
#   behavior is inconsistent. Examples include a dedicated 'ê' key while 'ê' is
#   better supported by configuring the circumflex accent dead key accordingly,
#   as well as unrelated dead characters for hook, horn, and most combinations.
#   Unicode added U02D8..U02DD to the Latin-1 diacritics merely for roundtrip
#   compatibility with pre-existing character sets.
#
#   Both NBSP (AltGr + SP) and NNBSP (AltFr + SP) are used as base characters.
#   Since DIAERESIS and CEDILLA do exist only in Latin-1, they are accessible
#   both ways. By contrast, Latin-1 MACRON and ACUTE ACCENT are duplicates of
#   modifier letters (by NNBSP) and are accessible by NBSP exclusively. Then,
#   ASCII symbols GRAVE ACCENT, CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT, TILDE are included as well.
#
#
# # Dead characters for documentation purposes
#
#   This representative sign works on Windows as the so-called dead character.
#   On MacOS it is the terminator. Both OSes output it when the base character
#   is not listed with the current dead key, prior to outputting the unchanged
#   base character itself. XCompose, by contrast, has no output in this case.
#
#   Traditionally, this character is output on hitting space after a dead key,
#   but space is now reserved for the related combining diacritic.
#
#   For cross-platform compatibility, base characters cannot be input with the
#   AltFr modifier, because MacOS needs to switch layout in order to emulate a
#   modifier key like AltFr. As a consequence, the base character for the dead
#   character is U00A7 SECTION SIGN, rather than U00B5 MICRO SIGN.
#   However, as an exception to the rule, the group selector dead key has its
#   dead character output for documentation purposes with <dollar>.
#   See #*# GROUP1
#
#
# # Combining diacritics
#
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose has combining diacritics with <nobreakspace>, probably assuming that
#   both dead keys and NBSP are on level 3, while <space> yields a legacy spacing character
#   as far as this is available; not e.g. for dead_hook.
#
#   Those among these spacing characters that are in the ASCII range are not usefully
#   generated by dead key, because they should be easily accessible on live keys.
#   Hence it is proposed to use <space> to get the combining diacritic throughout.
#   This feature is implemented since 2010 on J. ‘Mach’ Wust’s US Custom keyboard layout
#   for macOS: http://uscustom.sourceforge.net/
#
#   Indeed the Unicode Standard version 11.0.0, section 5.2, page 220 states:
#
#      A common implementation for the input of combining character sequences is the use of
#      dead keys. These keys match the mechanics used by typewriters to generate such sequences
#      through overtyping the base character after the nonspacing mark. In computer implemen-
#      tations, keyboards enter a special state when a dead key is pressed for the accent and
#      emit a precomposed character only when one of a limited number of “legal” base characters
#      is entered. It is straightforward to adapt such a system to emit combining character
#      sequences or precomposed characters as needed.
#
#      Typists, especially in the Latin script, are trained on systems that work using dead keys.
#      However, many scripts in the Unicode Standard (including the Latin script) may be imple-
#      mented according to the handwriting sequence, in which users type the base character first,
#      followed by the accents or other nonspacing marks (see Figure 5-4).
#
#   As a result, keyboard layouts should feature both dead keys and easy access to combining marks.

#   Following en_US.UTF-8/Compose, the most synergistic character after dead keys, ZWSP, duplicates
#   the combining diacritics. Conversely, the NBSP is repurposed to yield spacing diacritics as did
#   en_US.UTF-8/Compose with ordinary space.
#
#   "¤" U00A4 # CURRENCY SIGN is an exception to the rule.
#
#   This list supports combining diacritics from U0300 to U0339 plus U1DCB.
#   Items are ordered by dead keys. Combined dead keys are listed last.

# # Composed diacriticized letters
#
#   Due to a technical limitation on Windows, caused by defining the wrong data
#   type for dead key output i.e. for the DEADTRANS function’s return value, we
#   cannot get composed letters nor characters from a Supplemental Multilingual
#   Plane output by dead keys in the Text Services Framework of Windows. Hence,
#   this section is not cross-platform compatible. When porting this on Windows
#   programmatically, the script needs to filter out all composed letters while
#   listing them in an extra file for documentation in order to advise to input
#   these sequences on Windows by adding combining diacritics.
#   See # # Combining diacritics
#
#   However, in the Unicode encoding model, precomposed letters with peripheral
#   marks are considered legacy; no new ones are encoded any more.
#   As a result, many composed letters with diacritics are used in practice.
#   Therefore the Unicode Standard 11.0.0, §5.2, p. 220 specifies:
#
#      A common implementation for the input of combining character sequences is
#      the use of dead keys. These keys match the mechanics used by typewriters
#      to generate such sequences through overtyping the base character after
#      the nonspacing mark. In computer implementations, keyboards enter a
#      special state when a dead key is pressed for the accent and emit a
#      precomposed character only when one of a limited number of “legal” base
#      characters is entered. It is straightforward to adapt such a system to
#      emit combining character sequences or precomposed characters as needed.
#      Typists, especially in the Latin script, are trained on systems that work
#      using dead keys. However, many scripts in the Unicode Standard (including
#      the Latin script) may be implemented according to the handwriting sequence,
#      in which users type the base character first, followed by the accents or
#      other nonspacing marks (see Figure 5-4).
#
#   In XCompose, composed letters must be defined as literal strings.
#   The only Latin composed letter in en_US.UTF-8/Compose is J WITH ACUTE.
#   Cyrillic has more.

# # Order
#
#   Dead keys in this file are ordered following the AZERTY keyboard layout.
#   See: # # Actionable dead key layout for Latin keyboards
#
#   Heading levels are differentiated, in that the main dead keys with mappings
#   on keys are prefixed `#*# `, the dead keys virtualized by double or triple,
#   rarely quadruple press are prefixed `#^# `, and the other dead keys `# # `.
#
#   Dead keys are further ordered following this scheme:
#
#       1.    #*# Main dead key
#       2.    # # Dead key in group
#       3.    # # Dead key combination with one or more other dead keys
#       4.    #^# Dead key virtualized by multiple press
#
#   The order of base characters matters too, since this file is also used for
#   documentation: spaces, §, quotedbl, apostrophes, symbols, digits, letters.
#

#
#   Combining marks and spacing clones of diacritics are listed first,
#   eventually followed by the dead character with the <section> sign
#   as the base character, although this is relevant on Windows as the

#   Superscript small q is part of Unicode since v14.0 released in 2020.
#   https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20117-modifier-letter-suppt.pdf
#   There had been an attempt to encode superscript q in isolation with
#   a rationale based on road signs. A new take argued that a full set
#   of superscript letters is convenient for keyboard layout design.
#   The first proposal encountered strong headwinds from the industry,
#   and both attempts to complete the small letter alphabet failed.
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2010/10230-modifier-q.pdf
#   https://unicode.org/L2/L2010/10316-cmts.pdf
#
#   While there is a consensus to include superscript letters in
#   Unicode for phonetic notation, making abbreviation indicators
#   plain text is traditionally fiercely opposed by members of the
#   Consortium for software marketing reasons.
#
#   When character names on a MODIFIER LETTER basis were introduced,
#   this became the new term for “superscript”, while “subscript”
#   remained unchanged.
#
#   Superscript lowercase letters, most extensively used as abbreviation
#   indicators in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, spoken
#   by one third of the world's population, are on live keys too and
#   support combining diacritics.
#
#   The uppercase alphabet is less complete, but some letters are used
#   for natural languages.
#   In 2020 and 2021, more uppercase letters were added: C, F, Q.

#   Lithuanian requires a hard dot on i and j. The sequences with dot above are
#   a workaround, since the hard dot on i and j is a feature of Lithuanian, and
#   should not depend on user input, but on font settings instead.

#
#   The dead character base letter is `e` for consistency with dead_belowtilde,
#   that is precomposed only with e, i, u.

#   Greek dead key update
#
#   When dead_greek was designed and added to en_US.UTF-8/Compose, far ahead of
#   ISO/IEC 9995-9, mappings were not yet synched with the Greek keyboard. That
#   is the reason of the discrepancies between en_US.UTF-8/Compose and current
#   keyboard standards, like NF Z71-300:2019 that tries to be in synch with
#   ISO/IEC 9995-9:2016. Please see for reference:
#   https://bepo.fr/wiki/Version_1.1rc2#Touches_mortes

#   The Greek dead key is mapped on D06 with the Y mnemonics of 'Greek I' (i grec).
#   Should this position be used otherwise, dead_greek is not indispensable, as
#   the Greek letters can be accessed in group 6, and by dead key chord based on
#   GR mnemonics of C05 (G, -, dead_stroke) and D04 (R, }, *dead_retroflexhook) as
#   the bar and the retroflex hook are not found together on precomposed letters.
#   See # # GROUP6
#
#   For non-letters, dead_greek single press is used as a dead key for CIRCLED,
#   alongside dead_greek double press virtualizing the ordinary general-purpose
#   *dead_circled.
#
#   This dead key applies a scheme where zero yields circled number 10.

#   J WITH ACUTE is in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, but Ĳ́ ĳ́ with acute is not rendered
#   correctly in some fonts. It should have an accent on each letter making up
#   the digraph.

#
#   Followed by Éé, acute is a shortcut to Ãã for Portuguese with spatial
#   mnemonics on AZERTY as A is close to É.
#
#   Followed by Àà, acute is a shortcut to Õõ for Portuguese with spatial
#   mnemonics on AZERTY as O is close to À.
#
#   The acute accent below virtual dead key is removed as designed to foster a
#   better quotation input method. The only two acute below characters are now
#   with underscore for "ˏ" U02CF # MODIFIER LETTER LOW ACUTE ACCENT, and with
#   ampersand for "̗" U0317 # COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT BELOW.

#   Also used as a synonym of STROKE in mathematical symbols, except in those

#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   The DOUBLE_ACUTE dead key is also required for consistency with the symbols
#   mapped on level 3, and with the new-school Compose scheme, where every dead

# # Oslash and Aring for Danish, Norwegian and other languages
#
#   ISO layouts have "Øø" in group 1 on Oo, and "Œœ" on Ee. For intuitivity
#   and predictability, Oslash is supported in dead_longsolidusoverlay, and
#   both letters Ææ and Œœ are in group 1 on Aa and Oo in this layout. As a
#   convenience for Danish and other languages using Oslash, this is mapped
#   to Ccedilla and Odiaeresis in group 1. On AZERTY, Ccedilla is above the
#   O key, while Swiss QWERTZ has also an Odiaeresis live key.

# # Superscript square and cube for African and Breton variants
#
#   The first positions on key E01 are used for ɛ, Ɛ or cʼh, Cʼh.
#   The ² and ³ superscripts are on Shift + AltGr of 2 and 3 anyway.
#
#   For ease of access, the ² and ³ superscripts are also in group 1 and

#
#   Additionally agrave/Agrave, mapped on the digit 0 key of AZERTY, had

# # Tabular minus sign
#
#   The FIGURE DASH is a tabular minus sign used in typesetting tables,
#   not in interval notation, although it was sometimes recommended for
#   that purpose.
#   https://web.archive.org/web/20210224183416/http://www.technicalauthoring.com/wiki/index.php/Figure_dash
#
#   Since FIGURE DASH occurs in single instances only, it is compatible
#   with dead key input, unlike FIGURE SPACE and PUNCTUATION SPACE that
#   are the tabular digit and punctuation spaces, respectively, and are
#   mapped on live keys AltGr + AltFr + B07, B08 when ModLock is on.
#
#   However, FIGURE DASH is also mapped on live key Shift + AltFr + T,
#   where MINUS SIGN is on AltFr.

# # Arrows as on the numpad
#
#   These are needed to palliate a lack of the dedicated or integrated numpad.
#
#   Five sets of arrows, and ten arrow emoji have an input method using digits
#   0..9 in groups 2..7. The digits are based on the position of cursor arrows
#   on the numpad on keys 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8. The remaining single headed arrows
#   are extrapolated; double headed left-right is placed on 5, up-down on 0.
#
#   Group 1 is not used here, since digits in group 1 are dead keys activating
#   other groups. And groups 8 and 10 are used for mathematical symbol digits,
#   U1D7D8.. (double-struck) and U1D7E2.. (sans-serif). So groups 9, 11 and 12
#   are used for additional arrow sets: U2B70.. (triangle-headed to bar) as of
#   BMP arrows, and the wide-headed U1F860.. (light) and U1F880.. (very heavy)
#   in the SMP. The sans-serif set U1F850.. is skipped as not providing enough
#   added value with respect to the fact that on most computers (Windows), SMP
#   characters are hard to input inside the TSF using only layout drivers with
#   the wrong data type picked for dead key output. 0 and 5 are used for input
#   of the high surrogate that is part of these wide-headed barb arrows.

#*# CURRENCY
#   dead_currency
#   Multi_key: ¦$
#
#   This is 100% backwards compatible with en_US.UTF-8/Compose except for
#   double press, used as CURRENCY_EXTENDED instead of the currency sign.
#   See <Multi_key><x><o>
#
#   Integral symbols are also supported, based on S mnemonics, with the
#   corresponding digits as base characters. Likewise, contour integrals
#   are also supported, although they are also in dead_abovering.
#   See #*# RING_ABOVE
#
#   Letters Jj Qq Vv Xx Zz are unused in en_US.UTF-8/Compose dead_currency,
#   while 9 symbols are left over among support by base letters.
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, the BENGALI RUPEE MARK requires a thorn live key,
#   while the INDIAN RUPEE SIGN is supported only by Multi_key =R sequences.
#   The other seven symbols are unsupported by en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#
#   New base:
#   J        "৲" U09F2 # BENGALI RUPEE MARK
#   j        "₹" U20B9 # INDIAN RUPEE SIGN
#   Q        "₹" U20B9 # INDIAN RUPEE SIGN alternative
#   q        "֏" U058F # ARMENIAN DRAM SIGN
#   V        "₺" U20BA # TURKISH LIRA SIGN
#   v        "₾" U20BE # LARI SIGN
#   X        "₸" U20B8 # TENGE SIGN
#   x        "₼" U20BC # MANAT SIGN
#   Z        "₽" U20BD # RUBLE SIGN
#   z        "₷" U20B7 # SPESMILO SIGN
#
#   These are also supported in the new double press CURRENCY_EXTENDED,
#   as well as the following:
#
#   "₿" U20BF # BITCOIN SIGN
#   "₶" U20B6 # LIVRE TOURNOIS SIGN
#   "₻" U20BB # NORDIC MARK SIGN
#
#   See #^# CURRENCY_EXTENDED
#
#   These are duplicated on another base letter as well:
#
#   "৲" U09F2 # BENGALI RUPEE MARK
#   "₢" U20A2 # CRUZEIRO SIGN
#   "₵" U20B5 # CEDI SIGN
#   "₱" U20B1 # PESO SIGN
#   "௹" U0BF9 # TAMIL RUPEE SIGN
#
#   "₵" U20B5 # CEDI SIGN has Ccedilla as a base character too, for consistency
#   with en_US.UTF-8/Compose.

#   This also supports the new U1DF00 LATIN SMALL LETTER FENG DIGRAPH WITH TRILL
#   because the TRILL looks like two inverted breves or a double inverted breve.
#
#   As inverted breve has only 6×2 precomposed letters, it might be virtualized
#   by dead breve double press, but it has a dead key of its own for consistency
#   with ASCII symbols, and thanks to its XKB X11 keysym dead_invertedbreve.
#
#   Inverted breve has no reported usage outside Unicode precomposed letters.

#   The digit position sets the direction clockwise: up, right, down, left;
#   and a digit sets the stroke type: 0 for none,
#                                     1 for light,
#                                     2 for double,
#                                     3 for heavy.
#
#   Multiple dashes are input by the number of dashes, typed once for light,
#   twice for heavy, terminated by `h` for horizontal, or `v` for vertical.
#
#   Diagonals are input by 1 for the slash slant, 2 for the backslash slant,
#   both for cross, terminated by `d` for diagonal.
#
#   Rounded corners use dead_invertedbreve and its Multi_key equivalent ¦( with
#   graphic mnemonics based on the shape of uppercase letter D on C03, and with
#   neighborship mnemonics.

#
#   The BELT diacritic cannot be merged with the BREVE, because of the composed
#   L with combining breve, used in Inng, while both the palatal hook ¦{{ and
#   the retroflex hook ¦} occur together with belt. BELT cannot be merged with
#   RING either, because this occurs as middle ring on small l. The mnemonics
#   for mapping BELT to BREVE or double breve is the similarity in shape.
#
#   This also supports BREVE_BELOW combining diacritics.

#
#   In XKB X11, the diacritic called “stroke” had an ambiguous shape, until the
#   horizontal stroke and the oblique stroke were disambiguated, by introducing
#   the new dead_longsolidusoverlay keysym named after U0338 "̸" COMBINING LONG
#   SOLIDUS OVERLAY as one of four extra dead elements for the German T3 layout
#   designed around 2010 and standardized in 2012 as DIN 2137:2012.
#
#   The use of dead_stroke for horizontal, rather than using it for oblique and
#   introducing *dead_bar/*dead_shortstrokeoverlay to cover horizontal, appears
#   to be fueled by the name of the combining diacritic and the character names
#   containing WITH STROKE with the meaning of WITH BAR, or BARRED like UAB33,
#   or like in the Unicode 1.0 name of U0197: “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER BARRED I”,
#   that Unicode renamed to its ISO name “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH STROKE”.
#
#   All barred letters occurring in orthographies have their precomposed letter
#   encoded in Unicode, since the overlay bar diacritics do not render well.

#   Unlike superscript letters, used as abbreviation indicators
#   in Latin-script-using languages, like in French, subscripts
#   are not used in standard orthographies of natural languages.
#
#   As Unicode has not encoded any uppercase subscript, uppercase
#   base letters are mapped to small caps, frequent in phonetics.
#
#   Preformatting and extensive coverage fuel expectations about
#   the ability to write text using these characters. Therefore,
#   missing letters output ∄ U2204 THERE DOES NOT EXIST instead.

#*# MACRON, LONG_LEG, TOPBAR
#   dead_macron
#   Multi_key: ¦|
#
#   Long leg is merged with macron thanks to empty intersection and
#   with mnemonics based on the macron Multi_key equivalent pipe |.
#
#   Small r with long leg has been obsoleted by IPA in 1989.
#
#   Cent and Cedi signs are supported by lack of C with macron, and
#   for consistency with en_US.UTF-8/Compose.

#*# STROKE
#   dead_longsolidusoverlay
#   Multi_key: ¦/
#
#   In XKB X11, the diacritic called “stroke” had an ambiguous shape, until the
#   horizontal stroke and the oblique stroke were disambiguated, by introducing
#   the new dead_longsolidusoverlay keysym named after U0338 "̸" COMBINING LONG
#   SOLIDUS OVERLAY as one of four extra dead elements for the German T3 layout
#   designed around 2010 and standardized in 2012 as DIN 2137:2012.
#
#   The use of dead_stroke for horizontal, rather than using it for oblique and
#   introducing *dead_bar/*dead_shortstrokeoverlay to cover horizontal, appears
#   to be fueled by the name of the combining diacritic and the character names
#   containing WITH STROKE with the meaning of WITH BAR, or BARRED like UAB33,
#   or like in the Unicode 1.0 name of U0197: “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER BARRED I”,
#   that Unicode renamed to its ISO name “LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH STROKE”.
#
#   For convenience, to account for this confusion, letters without a variant
#   with stroke have their barred variant duplicated in this dead key as well.
#
#   Mathematical symbols also by ACUTE, which acts as a quick access,
#   unless a quick access sequence conflicts with regular support.
#   See #*# ACUTE

#   Multi_key: ¦<
#
#   Followed by quotedbl, apostrophe or rightsinglequotemark, dead_circumflex
#   yields turned high, opening or closing curly quotation marks U2018, U201C.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   The polygrams -êk-, -êl-, -êm-, -ên-, -êp-, -êq-, -êr-, -êt-, -êv-, -êch-
#   make dead_circumflex behave like an Ê key in most cases by using the fact
#   that the letters k, l, m, n, p, q, r, t, v, x do not exist as precomposed
#   letters with circumflex accent.
#
#   Likewise, a Ç key is emulated for use on the Canadian French variant.
#   See #*# CEDILLA
#
#   Cross-platform compatibility is full on MacOS, but only partial on Windows.
#   Windows is able to support only lowercase and only digrams, provided that
#   the dead key is given the appropriate dead character. For the circumflex
#   accent dead key, that is U00EA "ê" LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX.
#
#   French usage information: Courtesy _La fée des lettres_ https://www.motsavec.com.
#
#   The following sequences are included here, although they are overridden by
#   the Ê-key emulation required for writing French:
#   <dead_circumflex><M> : "M̂" # U004D U0302 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER M WITH CIRCUMFLEX Min Nan
#   <dead_circumflex><m> : "m̂" # U006D U0302 LATIN SMALL LETTER M WITH CIRCUMFLEX Min Nan
#   <dead_circumflex><N> : "N̂" # U004E U0302 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N WITH CIRCUMFLEX Min Nan
#   <dead_circumflex><n> : "n̂" # U006E U0302 LATIN SMALL LETTER N WITH CIRCUMFLEX Min Nan
#   Courtesy https://www.frathwiki.com/Circumflex
#
#   The circumflex dead key also supported superscript digits, for the sake of
#   conformance with NF Z71-300:2019, 6.3.3 p24, that E DIN 2137-1:2020-11 has
#   been synced with.
#   https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_2137#%C3%9Cberarbeitung_2020
#
#   But the Multi_key equivalent of this way to input superscript digits cannot
#   be supported, since it conflicts with "❤" U2764 as of "³" U00B3, and with a
#   new sequence introduced for the less frequent "♥" U2665 as of "⁸" U2078.
#   However, for cross-platform compatibility all Multi_key equivalents must be
#   supported. As a result, superscript by dead_circumflex is dropped entirely.
#   The diaeresis dead key offers an acceptable alternative with good mnemonics
#   using the traditional mapping on the same key in shift position. Ultimately
#   this feature is non-critical since a dedicated superscript dead key is also
#   present, in NF Z71-300:2019 too. Moreover, superscript and subscript digits
#   are on live keys.
#   See #*# DIAERESIS
#
#   NOTE: In en_US.UTF-8/Compose that the superscript digits by dead_circumflex
#   feature comes from, the superscript dead key is missing, consistently with
#   the *dead_superscript or equivalent keysym missing in keysymdef.h.
#
#   Followed by Çç, circumflex is a shortcut to Ññ for Breton and Spanish.
#
#   U017F LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S, in group 3 of s, has an additional input
#   method by <dead_circumflex><f> since French has no words including an -êf-.
#   Plus, <dead_circumflex><dollar> also yields the same small letter.
#
#   Likewise, U2300 DIAMETER SIGN, in group 1 of (, is given yet another input
#   method by <dead_circumflex><d>, <dead_circumflex><D> due to the fact that
#   French does not have any word with -êd-.
#
#   U016C LATIN CAPITAL LETTER U WITH BREVE is used in Esperanto and has thus a
#   shortcut by <dead_circumflex><B>, and U016D LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH BREVE
#   may alternatively be input by <dead_circumflex><b>. as French doesn’t have
#   any word with -êb-. Another pair of shortcuts uses Ugrave, since U has not
#   been encoded with circumflex and grave, as opposed to A, E and O.
#
#   Followed by comma or period, dead_circumflex provides a shorthand for U200C
#   ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER, and by asterisk, for U2042 ASTERISM.
#
#   Supporting the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols high surrogate is designed
#   for portability, but on Linux and ChromeOS it is ineffective.

#   The hacek dead key supports subscript digits, for the sake of conformance
#   with NF Z71-300:2019, 6.3.3 p24, that E DIN 2137-1:2020-11 has been synced
#   with.
#   https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_2137#%C3%9Cberarbeitung_2020
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   However, this redundancy with the subscript dead key is not extended to the
#   signs and parentheses, as the standard does not require these, and as their
#   Multi_key equivalents would conflict with many mathematical symbols. These
#   would need to be disambiguated by leading space.

#   In XKB, on single press, the dead key outputs the symbol with an
#   appended ZWNJ for letter emoji display and writing words.
#
#   The full set of existing flag emoji is supported on double press.
#   See #^# REGIONAL_INDICATOR_SYMBOL_PAIR
#
#   Regional indicator symbols in isolation are supported on triple press.
#   See #^# REGIONAL_INDICATOR_SYMBOL
#
#
#   Cross-platform compatibility
#
#   Windows supports an extra modifier added on Caps Lock for continuous input,
#   and also for composing flags. As in continuous input, ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
#   should be appended, on Windows, Shift would held down when inputting flags.
#
#   MacOS supports an iterative dead key for continuous input, on triple press.
#   As XKB has no support for iterative dead keys, the behavior of single press
#   and triple press is swapped, with single press outputting an appended ZWNJ,
#   and triple press outputting regional indicator symbol letters in isolation.
#
#   In en_US.UTF-8/Compose, sequences starting with ¦= conflict with currency signs
#   and double acute, given that en_US.UTF-8/Compose uses ¦", not ¦:, for diaeresis,
#   and so cannot use ¦" for <dead_doubleacute>, but must use ¦= instead.
#   Restricting currency signs to EQUALS SIGN *after* letter solves this issue.
#   See # # Currency symbols
#
#
#   Auxiliary characters
#
#   Auxiliary characters are supported with base characters in synergy:
#   The Multi_key equivalents are impractical, but full ASCII equivalents
#   would conflict with mathematical symbols.
#
#   *  ZWNJ is used to prevent an ISO code letter pair from being displayed
#      as a flag;
#   *  WJ is used to prevent an RI character from breaking off a character of
#      another class;
#   *  Supporting the high surrogate is designed for portability, but on Linux
#      and ChromeOS it is ineffective.

#
#   Followed by quotedbl, apostrophe or rightsinglequotemark, dead_diaeresis
#   yields low, opening, curly quotation marks U201A, U201E.
#   See # # Quotation mark input method
#
#   Superscript digits, formerly in dead_circumflex, are also supported for the
#   sake of NF Z71-300:2019. However, this redundancy with the superscript dead
#   key is not extended to the signs and parentheses since NF Z71-300:2019 does
#   not require these, and their Multi_key equivalents would conflict with many
#   mathematical symbols. that would need to be disambiguated by leading space.
#   See #*# CIRCUMFLEX
#
#   Diaeresis also supports hyphen and long dashes, with base characters on the
#   upper row, which makes sense as dead_diaeresis is on the base level of E05.
#   The HYPHEN punctuation has been separately encoded as U2010, although it is
#   a homoglyph to U002D in most fonts. U2010 is in group 1 of ASCII hyphen.
#   Other facilities are available using Multi_key or the group selector.
#   See # # Dashes and hyphens
#   See # # Hyphen and long dashes
#
#   Also used as a synonym of EQUAL in mathematical symbols, except for those
#   of these quick access sequences that conflict with regular support.
#   See #*# EQUAL
#
#   Two less expected yet heavily used symbols, "‖" U2016 DOUBLE VERTICAL LINE
#   and "¦" U00A6 BROKEN BAR repurposed as Multi_key symbol, have quick access
#   by dead_diaeresis followed by bar or slash, and backslash respectively, as
#   these symbols are in group 3 of | for ‖, and in group 9 of | for ¦.
#
#   Supporting the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols high surrogate is designed
#   for portability, but on Linux and ChromeOS it is ineffective.

### Group selector introduction
#
#   The private use character UEFB0 is used as the group selector dead key.
#   Patch for *dead_group <UEFD0>, for addition to en_US.UTF-8/Compose.
#   As a special dead key, the group selector deserves particular attention.
#
#
# # Numbering
#
#   CAUTION: Unlike specified in ISO/IEC 9995, group numbers are zero based.
#   For UX consistency, the default group is group 0. Only groups accessed by
#   the group selector dead key are numbered starting with 1, because a group
#   accessed by an n-uple press on the group selector must be called “group n”,
#   not “group n+1”. The ISO/IEC 9995 standard uses 1-based numbering because
#   it uses the terms “primary” and “secondary” with respect to groups, and it
#   does not consider dead key based group selection with multiple presses.
#
#   The short identifier for group n is gn.
#
#
# # History
#
#   The group selector dead key has been introduced by Karl Pentzlin while
#   implementing DIN 2137-2:2012 on Windows. Virtual dead keys accessed by
#   multiple dead key presses have been introduced by the French ergonomic
#   bépo keyboard layout project in 2015 while upgrading to version 1.1 for
#   the NF Z71-300:2019 standard.
#
#   *dead_group is used when levels are exhausted by Level5 modifier and toggle.
#   XKB supports the ISO/IEC 9995 conformant group selection since 2013, see
#   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60991
#   But its keysym mapping array is limited to a maximum number of 8 elements,
#   used up by the extra graphic modifier key required to support input methods
#   for the standard digital representation of numbers and measurement units
#   according to the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures BIPM, and of
#   French text using U202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE to space out big punctuation
#   marks following the French Imprimerie Nationale and French new-school
#   typesetting practice.
#
#
# # Cross-platform compatibility
#
#   Implementing the group selector as a dead key avoids breaking UX across
#   platforms, as Windows supports 6 + 1 modifiers but unsupports the ISO group
#   selector combo Shift + AltGr, and Apple has broken its technote TN2056 as
#   of around 2015 after previously allowing to use left Option as an extra
#   modifier, used by the German Neo ergonomic keyboard layout later emulating
#   left Option using the Karabiner Elements software from Takayama Fumihiko.
#
#
# # Maintenance
#
#   Filling empty slots with null output "" U0000 can be avoided. The "" U0000
#   strings have been removed for ease of maintenance on 2023-01-13T1356+0100.
#
#
#
### Space and symbol groups
#
#   The base characters in this section are mapped on AltGr/Option or unshifted
#   keys as of comma, period and space. Symbols and punctuation mapped on level
#   three assume using the group selector in synergy on AltGr/Option.
#
#   Consistently this section is ordered by keys rather than by code points, as
#   the order of the ASCII symbols on the keyboard layout is used for mnemonics
#   in synergy with the learning curve required by using the base alphabet as a
#   means to remember the symbols.
#
#
# # Ordinal indicators
#
#   French ordinal indicators are the preformatted superscript letters ᵈᵉʳˢ,
#   mapped to the AltGr + AltFr level, plus facilities for ᵉ and ʳ in AltGr.
#   The two Latin-1 ordinal indicators may be keyed in as a part of group 1,
#   on A and O respectively — Keys of F and M would be a bit less intuitive.
#   However, the base characters are asciicircum on A, and quotedbl on O, as
#   mapping them to alphabetic in group 1 is counterproductive by wasting as
#   much as four casing positions.

#
#   Emoji
#
#   Supporting all emoji in the Basic Multilingual Plane except Chinese letter
#   emoji makes sense because input by dead keys is cross-platform compatible.
#
#   A number of BMP emoji are supported alternatively or only elsewhere:
#
#       * See # # Legal symbols
#       * See # # Western zodiacal signs emoji
#       * See # # Emoji
#       * See #   Arrow emoji
#
#   A number of Supplemental Multilingual Plane emoji are mapped on live keys.
#
#   The two emoji-related variation selectors are in group 10 on key E, D03,
#   for emoji style, VS16 UFE0F, and on key T, D05, for text style, VS15 UFE0E.
#
#   The five emoji skin tone modifiers based on the 6-shades Fitzpatrick scale
#   are in group 10 on D06..D10.

#   The arrows in groups 1 and 2 have alphabetic mnemonics in French, where
#   an “arrow” is a “flèche”. This is consistent with DIN 2137 since the 2023
#   revision switched arrows on U and P keys for the right-pointing to be on
#   “P wie Pfeil”, “arrow” in German.

#
#   The preferred name and abbreviation of U2009 are NARROW SPACE, NSP.
#   An alternate, more intuitive name of U200B is WORD NON-JOINER.
#   https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/tools/cldr-code/src/main/java/org/unicode/cldr/util/CodePointEscaper.java
#   For consistency, WNJ is used in documentation rather than ZWSP.
#   https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-16631
#
#   The French name of U200B is CÉSURE CONDITIONNELLE, break opportunity.
#
#   For ease of input, U2002 and U2003 are on level 1, although they were
#   originally intended to be no-break. That brings the need to put their
#   breaking clones on level3, since they are now canonically equivalent.
#   U2002..U2006 and U2008..U200A were originally intended to be no-break
#   just like U2007 FIGURE SPACE.
#
#   Unlike stated in UAX #14, U2007 is not intended for use *in* figures,
#   but *before* figures for indentation in tables. Therefore, it is also
#   called tabular digit space, as opposed to tabular punctuation space.
#   https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14
#
#   U205F MEDIUM MATHEMATICAL SPACE is a breaking 4/18 em, or 4½-per-em.
#
#   U3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE does not hang into the margin.

### Letter groups
#
#   On the alphabet, the groups yield:
#
#   Group  0  (g0): live keys (default, no group selected);
#   Group  1  (g1): group selector pressed once: Latin;
#   Group  2  (g2): group selector pressed twice: Latin;
#   Group  3  (g3): group selector pressed thrice or followed by digit 3 or dead_circumflex: Latin;
#   Group  4  (g4): group selector pressed 4 times or followed by digit 4 or dead_acute: Latin;
#   Group  5  (g5): group selector then digit 5 or dead_diaeresis: Latin;
