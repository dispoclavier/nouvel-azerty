//
// ## XKB layout group 2
//
// A second graphic toggle is required to toggle the row E keys between letters
// and digits, independently of the CapsLock toggle, that is set to also affect
// the diacriticized letters, most of which are on row E too. This digit toggle
// cannot be implemented by repurposing the NumLock toggle. Consistently, this
// solution was commented out in xkb/types/level5 back in 2016 (later causing a
// bug in xkbcomp when these types were uncommented again). These two types are
// EIGHT_LEVEL_LEVEL_FIVE_LOCK and EIGHT_LEVEL_ALPHABETIC_LEVEL_FIVE_LOCK.
//
// The working solution needs to use the ISO_First_Group and ISO_Last_Group for
// the purpose of toggling between two layout groups.
//
// This however is compromised by a rule in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev:
//
//       *		*		=	+%l[2]%(v[2]):2
//
// This rule causes the second group to get overridden by a default layout. The
// fix is to comment this rule out, although another fix seems to be working as
// well, according to a thread on Unix & Linux StackExchange, where this issue
// has been discussed and solved in 2018.

// ## X Window Input Method
//
// Multi character output, including composed letters as required for output by
// dead keys, requires XIM. These semi-automatic keyboard layouts output multi-
// character sequences, such as spaced punctuation and the Breton trigraph, on
// live keys too and can only work when XIM has been activated, given that iBus
// may still be set as the default.
//
// The X Window Input Method may be activated by command line:
//
//         im-config -n xim
//
//
// # Documentation
//
// ##  French-style punctuation spacing semi-automation
//
// These layouts support output of polygrams after single keystrokes.
//
//
// ### Requirements
//
// The requirements about spacing out big punctuation marks in French text depend on
// the sublocale, the typesetting school and, for some sublocales, software support.
//
// In France, the new-school rules require a no-break thin space before ? ! : ; » ›,
// and after « ‹. They are followed in print editions of high-end newspapers, namely
// Le Monde, without being well documented, so as to prevent conflicts with the old
// school whose specification is the verbatim text of the National Printing Office’s
// style guide “Lexique des règles en usage à l’Imprimerie nationale”, stipulating a
// justifying no-break space before a colon, and inside the “guillemet” double angle
// quotation marks. In its eighth edition, of March 2017, a reprint of its July 2002
// edition, the colon is indeed spaced out as specified, whereas the angle quotation
// marks are spaced out the new-school way, with the same thin space used before the
// other three big punctuation marks question mark, exclamation mark, and semicolon.
// The verbatim text was not synced with the evolving usage, supposedly with respect
// to the strong user community tracking changes and possibly frowning upon this one
// because equally spaced-out guillemets are an outstanding feature in old printing.
// The new usage of the Imprimerie Nationale as of spacing out guillemets using thin
// space may be considered as intermediate typesetting school. About new school, see
// https://forums.macg.co/threads/typo-caracteres-capitales-accentues.25739/page-5#post-3151119
//
// Belgium applies either the French Imprimerie Nationale style guide or NBN Z01-002
// specifying that the punctuation marks ? ! : ; must not be spaced out. Guillemets
// as angle quotes are not mentioned in https://cuy.be/orthotypo/NORMES_D.pdf#page=12
//
// Canada has peculiar rules applying old school typesetting but suppressing the thin
// space if it is unavailable, in that the software does not insert it automatically.
// https://vitrinelinguistique.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?id=22039
// https://vitrinelinguistique.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/22039/la-typographie/espacement/espacement-avant-et-apres-les-signes-de-ponctuation-et-les-symboles
//
// Francophone Switzerland changed in 2015 from not spacing out to following France,
// but the reference is missing.
// And Franck Pastor reported on 2009-05-19 in http://www.cuk.ch/articles/4116/ that
// no-break thin space was already used also before colon and inside anqle quotation
// marks. In 2020, the University of Geneva has a rule about not spacing out ?!:;«»,
// but this rule is restricted to electronic usage, as which were considered website
// publishing, and email text body. Thus the spacing prohibition targets plain text,
// where NO-BREAK SPACE is unstable and may be replaced with SPACE in mail composers
// affected by a common bug, and HTML, where NO-BREAK SPACE is justifying, unlike it
// is in word processors other than Word 2013. As of NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE, it isn’t
// mentioned in the rule, but print and PDF are not mentioned either in the document
// https://www.unige.ch/communication/files/7815/9180/2109/ReglesTypographiques-UNIGE-2020.pdf#page=6
//
//
// ###  Technical note about French Old School typesetting
//
// Spacing colon and guillemets out with NO-BREAK SPACE does not work well because:
//
// 1  NO-BREAK SPACE (NBSP) is defined as justifying in Unicode, followed by HTML,
//    while in word processors (except MS Word 2013) it is tailored as fixed-width.
//    As a result, the colon is not spaced out the Old School way in word processors,
//    while on the web, question and exclamation mark and semicolon are neither.
// 2  MS Word replaces NBSP with SPACE when copy-pasting to plain text, resulting
//    in typesetting destruction. Web browsers like Chrome and Firefox do the same.
// 3  NBSP behaves like (or is replaced with) normal space in e-mail composers and
//    in web forms in many browsers.
//
//
// ###  French New School typesetting
//
// French new-school typesetting spaces out all big punctuation characters using the
// same non-breaking thin space both for ASCII ?!; and even colon, and for double angle
// quotation marks. The moderate old-school typesetting exemplified in the style guide
// of the French National Printing Office makes a special case for the colon, preceded
// by the justifying NO-BREAK SPACE, while the hard-core old school, described therein,
// sets apart the angle quotation marks too.
//
// The International System of Measures and Units (SI) from the BIPM recommends using
// a non-breaking thin space as a group separator in numbers, and it is followed by
// many locales including fr_FR. Also TeX supports it by the means of the '\,' command.
// Known for its consistency with legacy typographic craftmanship, Donald Knuth’s TeX
// maintained the thin space’s non-breaking behavior, and as a pre-Unicode environment
// it presumably informed the seminal Unicode Standard known for carefully maintaining
// full backwards compatibility.
//
// All layouts in this configuration file support mainstream practice used
// in the French graphic industry, also referred to as French New School.
// https://forums.macg.co/threads/typo-caracteres-capitales-accentues.25739/page-5#post-3151119
//
// The interoperable representation of French New School typesetting uses
// NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE with all punctuation characters that use to be spaced out,
// i.e. not only semicolon, exclamation mark and question mark as explicitly stated
// in the verbatim text of the Imprimerie nationale style guide, 2002 edition:
// _Lexique des règles typographiques en usage à l’Imprimerie nationale_
// but also the guillemets the way they are actually typeset in the 2002 edition,
// March 2017 reprint, ISBN 9782743304829, plus the colon.
//
// Single angle quotation marks are spaced out like double angle quotation marks.
// https://vitrinelinguistique.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?id=22039
//
//
// ###  Unicode support for interoperable French
//
// In Unicode, a non-breaking thin space is encoded only since version 3.0, released in
// 1999, when U+202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE was encoded for Mongol script, but with the
// Script property Common and in the General Punctuation block. It was not so earlier,
// because U+2009 THIN SPACE was not assigned line breaking class GL. Another suitable
// space character, U+2008 PUNCTUATION SPACE, was not either, unlike U+2007 FIGURE SPACE.
// That flaw was introduced in the Unicode Standard on purpose, and in this case it is
// relatively easy to assess intentionality thanks to the typographic space range keeping
// original code points. Originally the typographic space range U+2000..U+200A was set up
// to include the two widest spaces both in a breaking variant (U+2000, U+2001) and in
// a non-breaking variant (U+2002, U+2003), making a clever use of aliases provided in
// Unicode’s template, the Xerox Character Code Standard, whereas all narrower spaces
// (U+2004..U+200A) would be non-breaking throughout. The initial design is lacking its
// official documentation because it was altered in an early stage, so the widest spaces
// ended up as two pairs of duplicates, defeating the point in encoding them in both a
// breaking and a non-breaking variant as supported by Donald Knuth’s TeX consistently
// with TeX’s design goal of supporting the full range of features used in traditional
// typesetting. Despite Unicode shared this goal, only the digit-wide FIGURE SPACE was
// given the non-breaking property. However, this space is designed for use as a leading
// space before numbers, for indentation, not as a group separator space, unlike claimed
// in the Core Specification 1.0. Likewise, U+2008 PUNCTUATION SPACE was intended to be
// used for decimal or group separator wide indentation before numbers. Regardless, since
// the XCCS is lacking the thin space in Character set 0xEE as documented on Wikipedia
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Character_Code_Standard#Character_set_0xEE
// — indeed the Unicode Standard outperforms the XCCS by disambiguating SIX-PER-EM SPACE,
// THIN SPACE and PUNCTUATION SPACE, all of which the XCCS only includes the very last —
// the PUNCTUATION SPACE would as well be used as a group separator. For that purpose,
// PUNCTUATION SPACE should be non-breaking. Another reason why it should be so, is
// consistency with FIGURE SPACE. So there is multiple evidence that the originally
// intended line breaking class was GL, and only an intentionally destructive move
// away from the original design prevented PUNCTUATION SPACE and THIN SPACE from being
// non-breaking right away. That is how French and 57 other locales using space as a 
// group separator were unsupported by the Unicode Standard for almost a decade, and
// if Mongol script had been encoded back then, it would have been equally unsupported
// since it spaces punctuation marks out, much like French does, except that fonts use
// to be designed for Mongol script with built-in spacing next to punctuation characters.
//
// But even after encoding NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE, the need of non-breaking thin space in
// representing French remained unaddressed until UAX #14 Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm
// started mentioning it in 2007, and the Core Specification in 2014. Both do now declare
// U+202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE as representing “the space next to certain punctuation
// characters in French text.” That delay was useful to account for lagging font support.
// A competing workaround used THIN SPACE followed by then-standard line break preventer
// U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE, or since 2002, U+2060 WORD JOINER. Still in practice,
// NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE was quickly adopted by the French typesetting industry because it
// caters for a longstanding demand.
//
// The Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) has started migrating the group separator space
// from U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE to U+202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE in version 34 released in 2018.
// This migration first benefitted the French main locale fr-FR and its heirs, but not fr-CA.
// It is likely to be extended soon as per comment on 2021-03-12:
// https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-11423?focusedCommentId=160553
// https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-11217
//
// In 2019, Unicode had assigned NNBSP the Script_Extensions property value {Latn Mong}
// tending to discourage other scripts from using the correct group separator space.
//

//
// ##  Name and mapping of the level 5 modifier key
//
// The ISO/IEC 9995 standard does not support the level 5 modifier, because it
// is limited to low-performance Western keyboard layouts and excludes all the
// features found on Japanese keyboards such as the halfwidth/fullwidth toggle
// (hankaku/zenkaku kanji) on B00, the left and the right Thumb Shift modifiers
// (Oyayubi Shifuto). ISO does not even provide numbers for these, calling the
// spacebar A03
// https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/specs/kbd/scancodes-7.html
//
// A Windows equivalent of the XKB level 5 modifier key is used in Jan James’
// implementation of a governmental avatar (by federal Government and industry
// representatives) of the Canadian multilingual standard keyboard layout by
// Alain LaBonté (initial design). Jan James was tasked with implementing the
// Canadian multilingual standard keyboard layout for Microsoft, transforming
// the group selector dead key into a level 5 modifier key, although initially,
// CAN/CSA Z243.200-92 was meant to comply with ISO/IEC 9995-2. But that is not
// how things are expected to work on properly designed keyboard layouts.
//
// Instead, keyboard layouts using a scheme like in this file have a level 5
// modifier located lefthand so as to be usable for an extended numpad below
// the 7 8 9 0 keys, where embedded numpads on compact keyboards are located,
// too.
//
// The repurposed level 5 modifier is called AltFr by analogy with AltGr and
// to account for its origin on French keyboard layouts, like Microsoft also
// called the peculiar Caps Lock mappings 'SGCaps', an abbreviation standing
// for 'Swiss-German Capitals'.
//
// This level 5 modifier is repurposed and moved to the left on the “ISO key”
// B00. On ANSI keyboards with ISO compatibility, where the ISO key takes the
// place of the Right Control key, Caps Lock and ISO key are swapped, so that
// AltFr is on the Caps Lock key whereas the latter is then on Right Control.
// On plain ANSI keyboards, the AltFr key can still be remapped to Caps Lock,
// and Caps Lock to Right Control.
//
// The proposed symbol is "⟰" U27F0 UPWARDS QUADRUPLE ARROW, by lack of a
// quintuple arrow and with the rationale that this key increments the level
// index by 4, on the background of the lack of a dedicated level-5 modifier
// key symbol in ISO/IEC 9995-7, due to ISO/IEC 9995 being limited to Western
// keyboards without support for Japanese modifiers and toggles. A limitation
// that subsequently backfired by impairing keyboard layout design efforts in
// Canada, France and other countries.
//
//
// ###  Punctuation spacing input methods
//
// Since computerized typewriting and typesetting have made horizontal spacing
// a question of inserting characters, both users and implementers are tempted
// to shift solid punctuation spacing out of the keyboard layout by relying on
// postprocessing or on hybrid input methods involving word processors, except
// where mapping a non-breaking space on Shift + Space is accepted to create a
// synergy with spacing-prone punctuation characters mapped on the Shift level
// and pressed almost simultaneously with the space bar.
// https://bepo.fr/wiki/Version_1.1rc1/Touches_vives/Espaces
//
// Users are divided over whether it is acceptable to input spaces separately.
// While spacing out punctuation is generally considered mandatory in French,
// doing so manually is seen as wasteful and inefficient by part of the users.
//
// These keyboard layouts support semiautomatic punctuation spacing, where the
// spaced-out punctuation characters and the unspaced-out ones are on the same
// key with different modifiers: Shift for spaced-out, AltFr for unspaced-out.
// Additionally, Shift + AltFr yields unspaced-out punctuation marks `?!:;`,
// with the rationale that after typing a spaced-out punctuation and while the
// little finger is still on Shift, the ring finger can easily press AltFr, so
// as to inhibit spacing before an additional question or exclamation mark.
//
// Advantages of Shift over AltFr for spaced-out punctuation characters:
//
//   1  Synergy between spaced-out punctuation and normal space;
//   2  Synergy between unspaced punctuation and extended numpad digits;
//   3  Unspaced punctuation is in synergy with no-break narrow space;
//   4  UX consistency between legacy and new as of the question mark;
//   5  Cross-mode UX consistency between writing French and programming;
//   6  Consistency between spacing and modifier key accessibility.
//
// Advantages of AltFr over Shift for spaced-out punctuation characters:
//
//   1  No inadvertent insertion of NNBSP while typing unspaced punctuation;
//   2  Consistency with the key name 'AltFr' as 'Alternate French' modifier;
//   3  Shift is often considered too far left, while AltFr is better placed;
//   4  Stability of the question mark as the only unmoved big punctuation;
//   5  Minimal cross-mode user experience inconsistency, as Shift is stable;
//   6  All strings involving no-break thin space have the same modifier key;
//
// The latter set of “advantages” fueled a design error, fixed only in v4.0.0.
// See Compose.yml  Acknowledgements
//
//
// ###  Synergistic vs semiautomatic punctuation spacing
//
// Spacing out certain punctuation characters is required in standard French and
// in Canadian French, where a non-breaking thin space is used with ?!; if it is
// available on the system, and certainly also with «» (and with ‹›) as inferred
// from the table below the rules on this page:
// https://vitrinelinguistique.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/22039/la-typographie/espacement/espacement-avant-et-apres-les-signes-de-ponctuation-et-les-symboles
//
// Word processing software is catering for punctuation spacing by automatically
// inserting NBSP when a colon, a semicolon, a question mark or exclamation mark
// is typed, with or without a preceding breaking space (replaced with an NBSP),
// and by replacing U+0022 QUOTATION MARK with the appropriate, spaced-out angle
// quotation mark. But the NBSP used is not preferred, because it is justifying.
// Therefore NBSP is tailored as fixed-width as long as the text is displayed in
// the software or exported in PDF, but not after copy-pasting in a blog editor.
//
// According to mainstream demand fostered by word processing autocorrection,
// users should not be required to input more than a normal space inside eligible
// punctuation characters, ideally less. This requirement can be met in 2 ways:
//
// a. Synergistic punctuation spacing.
//    Punctuation characters and non-breaking space are mapped on the same level.
//    That can be either level 2 or level 3. Some layouts feature angle quotation
//    marks and NBSP on level 3, while double ASCII punctuation (?!:;) is mostly
//    on level 2 or even level 1, where the space bar yields breaking space
//    except on the French BÉPO layout https://bepo.fr where they are on
//    level 2 along with NNBSP on the space bar (v1.1; NBSP in v1.0).
//
// b. Semi-automatic punctuation spacing.
//    Punctuation characters are mapped with NNBSP as polygrams on single key
//    positions along with the same punctuation characters mapped in isolation
//    on the same keys on other positions. Requirements:
//
//    1. Spaced-out and unspaced punctuation has the same ease of access.
//    2. The ModLock toggle, now mapped on key E00 instead of superscript 2,
//       toggles the spaced-out punctuation character positions to unspaced.
//    3. Question and exclamation mark used in repetition, first spaced out,
//       then unspaced, require spacing inhibition by additionally pressing
//       down a second modifier (AltFr).
//
// A. Advantages of synergistic over semiautomatic punctuation spacing:
//
//    1. Transparency. The knowledge about whether a punctuation mark is
//       being spaced out is intuitive: no spacebar press, no spacing.
//    3. Flexibility. The user decides in every instance whether a character
//       is spaced out or not, without significant change in gestures.
//    2. Simplicity. No multiple mapping of the same character with and without
//       semiautomatic spacing, no additional levels implied and required.
//
// https://next.ink/3020/clavier-azerty-ldlc-notre-bilan-apres-mois-dutilisation/#comment-67038
//
// B. Advantages of semiautomatic over synergistic punctuation spacing:
//
//    1. Speed: Only one single keystroke required instead of two.
//    2. Intuitivity: In French, the user focuses on punctuation, forgetting
//       about the space inside, notably not needing to remember that when
//       opening a quotation, it goes the other way around.
//    3. Continuity: Habits of letting the word processor manage punctuation
//       spacing when writing in French can be maintained.
//
// Synergistic variants started being added on 2020-02-08, and were intended
// for users writing primarily in other languages than French, and for users
// opposed to polygram output. They have been discontinued on 2021-01-27.
//
//
// ###  Standard typographic number input
//
// The NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE is used mainly as a group separator, for SI/BIPM
// conformant representation of numeric values with more than 3 digits before
// the comma. That brings the need to map NNBSP and digits on the same level.
// The first possible level is level 3 (when row E has diacriticized letters)
// and the next possible level is level 5. The digits on level 3 are used for
// short numbers followed by a word, where the justifying NO-BREAK SPACE must
// be used between the number and word. The digits on level 5 are mapped both
// the traditional way on row E, and in a pad below 7 8 9 with 0 on N, and 00
// on B, for easy input of numbers grouped into triads by the group separator
// NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE, which is a no-break thin space and as such is fixed
// width. The level 5 layout is useful too for number input with interspersed
// typographic operators. These require padding, where NNBSP can be used too.
//
//
// ## Note about EURO SIGN
//
// The EuroSign is required on key E, level 3 following a recommendation from
// the European Commission. While carfully avoiding any interference with the
// national keyboard standards, the EC has issued a recommendation to assign
// the euro sign the AltGr + e key position. Current hardware and keyboard
// layout drivers are consistent with this recommendation, and users largely
// adhere to it and have strong expectations accordingly.
// https://www.open-std.org/cen/tc304/Euro/Euroreport.html
//
// To achieve this, quotedbl is mapped on that key in order to be replaced by
// the euro sign due to being redundant, since quotedbl is on the base level,
// in French mode and in ASCII mode alike, keys E03 and D11, respectively.
//
// Additionally, EuroSign is tied to quotedbl by obvious mnemonics based on the
// double bar in the round (C-like) E, that the double acute accent on key E,
// level 4, also resonates with. Its Multi_key equivalent is quotedbl.
//
// The apparent isolation of quotedbl, away from apostrophe / single quote,
// benefits ergonomics of backslash in synergy with digits, while apostrophe is
// in the benefit of base level mappings both in French mode and in ASCII mode,
// much like quotedbl, on E05 and C11, respectively, and ASCII grave has easy
// level 3 access on B06 in both modes, plus level 3 access on C11 in ASCII
// mode only.
// See Compose.yml  Acknowledgements
//
// The euro sign is attached to the preceding numeric value using NNBSP, also
// used before abbreviated measurement units. As a consequence, the euro sign
// needs to be mapped on level 5 alongside, in synergy with NNBSP, and so are
// the dollar, pound, and yen signs, the latter two not on level 3 though.
//
// The linked page (https://www.open-std.org/cen/tc304/Euro/Euroreport.html)
// is from 1998 when the only “hard space” was NBSP, Since 1999 we have a NNBSP
// that is actually recommended before measurement unit abbreviations as well
// as currency short forms, because it is fixed-width, as opposed to NBSP that
// is justifying on the web and in MS Word 2013.
// https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_windows8/nonbreakable-space-justification-in-word-2016/4fa1ad30-004c-454f-9775-a3beaa91c88b
//
// The fact that quotedbl is on the E key, and apostrophe is on the U key based
// on AZERTY-QWERTY-QWERTZ, builds up some extra mnemonics, referring to the EU
// initialism. Also, both quotedbl and apostrophe have their HTML named entity,
// frequent `&quot;` and rare `&apos;`, on level 8 (Shift + AltGr + AltFr) like
// ampersand, less and greater, the latter two on level 7 (AltGr + AltFr).
//
//
// ### Keyboard levels and groups
//
// While “keyboard level” refers to user-perceived modifier key combinations,
// the 1-based array indices used in the allocation tables are named “Level1”
// through “Level8” in the key type definitions. The numerous key types help
// cope with the limitation to 8 indices in XKB allocation tables. The number
// of keyboard levels in user experience may be up to 8 using three modifiers
// (Shift, AltGr, AltFr). Since the ModLock toggle is a group toggle, it does
// not require any additional indices, but Caps Lock and Control may do so.
//
// The keysyms enclosed in brackets inside the braces define a group as used
// in XKB. In this file, each key has 2 groups. The first group is the default
// mode layout, and the second group is the ASCII mode layout. Each group has
// two names. The name in brackets may be called the identifier, and the name
// in double quotes is likely the descriptor, without any constraint as of
// uniqueness, although choosing unique descriptors makes for a better UX.
// https://www.charvolant.org/doug/xkb/html/node5.html#Sec:Symbols
//
//     The name[Group1]= "US/ASCII"; statement gives a name to one of the
//     keyboard groups. Other groups can be specified by using the same syntax
//     but with a different group name.
//
//     […]
//
//     Inside the braces, it is possible to use the syntax
//     group[groupname] = [ symbol, symbol] instead, with the various
//     statements being separated by commas.
//
// The term “group” is also used for dead-key-accessed groups, the most
// prominent of which are accessed through the “group selector” dead key, that
// also supports multiple presses. As a consequence, the group number matches
// the number of group selector key presses, or the digit entered after one
// group selector key press. Support for multiple group selector key presses
// goes at least up to 4. That is why groups are a 0-based array of 13 groups,
// where index 0 is the default layout. Digits 0..2 are used for groups 10..12.
//
// Given access to uppercase must be intuitive, digits are mapped on level 3.

	// The resulting availability bias is a consequence of Microsoft’s failed TSF

	// The edit key feature on the numpad is deactivated as outdated, redundant,

	// triple zero as found on electronic calculators, and for hexadecimal letter
	// digits in a layout consistent with the hexadecimal letter digits that are
	// part of the graphic numpad on the alphanumeric block, with digits 1..9 on
	// the same keys as the overlay numpad on compact keyboards. The use of E10
	// for an additional 0 ensuring an AltFr-AltGr symmetry with respect to the
	// row E digits, and both decimal separators dot and comma on D10 and C10 due
	// to using B07..B10 for unspaced punctuation marks, constrain the hex letter
	// digits to keys (C..E)(11..12). As a consequence, the numpad features A..F
	// on level 2 of keys 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9, with a downside of not featuring
	// the E in the center on key 5 like on the `Hexadecimal Numpad` keypad(hex)
	// by Roland Kaufmann <rlndkfmn at gmail dot com>.
	//
	// In default mode, these level 2 hex digits are uppercase, but lowercase in
	// ASCII mode, where also backslash is output rather than the fraction slash,
	// filling up the shifted position on shape-mnemonic key 7, while key 4 on U
	// has room for the full Unicode prefix in default mode, a `#` in ASCII mode.

	//
	// On desktop keyboards, the combos involving both LevelThree and LevelFive
	// are almost unusable, so initially, the AltGr + AltFr modifier combination
	// was not used, as these are hard to hold down simultaneously while using

	// The effect on user experience of the key combination AltFr + AltGr/Option

	// The numpad dot key can deliver all 3 separators used as decimal separator
	// or as group separator, also called thousands separator. Both dot and comma
	// as well as the no-break thin space U202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE are output
	// when pressing this key alone or with Shift or AltFr (or AltGr), similarly
	// to kbdl(kposs) © 2007 Nicolas Mailhot <nicolas.mailhot @ laposte.net>.
	//
	// The legacy U00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE is less easily input but still supported,
	// although it is dysfunctional in this usage, except on old systems where it
	// prevents worse issues, while paving the way of false confidence that fools
	// users into sticking with them, compromising cyber security.
	//
	// LevelThree (impractical) and LevelFive (recommended) have same effect.
	//
	// CapsLock affects levels 1 and 2 for toggling dot and comma.
	//
	// ABNT-2 keyboards feature a dot key above Enter, KPPT, while the widespread
	// decimal separator key besides Enter, KPDL, outputs a comma.

	// KP_Decimal translates to period, KP_Separator to comma. But there is no
	// guarantee that this mapping works out as expected, Nicolas Mailhot warns
	// in symbols/kpdl. This soft-coded map is picked here rather than one of the
	// hard-coded alternatives, considering that this setup might be expected to
	// be modifiable depending on regional preferences.
	//
	// The map below does not match the Brazilian locale, where KPDL is mapped to
	// KP_Separator, KPPT to KP_Decimal; it only ensures that there is a key for
	// comma and a key for period on numpads with two separator keys, and both
	// have NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE on level 3 and on level 5, although in
	// Brazilian Portuguese, the group separator is period, as opposed to

	// I and O are switched alongside D and L to improve the -élé- trigram, and
	// because 5.754 French words contain 'ion', and
	// 121 French words contain 'noi' (total: 5.875).
	// But only 280 French words contain 'oin', and
	// 110 French words contain 'nio' (total: 390).
	// Courtesy La Fée des Lettres https://www.motsavec.com/

	// Hybrid variants were also included until 2023-08-18 but were dropped as
	// pointless since keys W, X, C, V, B and even Z, Y, S are unremapped, for
	// the sake of frequent keyboard shortcuts, without substantially cutting
	// back on letter ergonomy. Moreover, the hybrid variants were truncated,
	// since the layout uses the full set of 8 indices, and shortcut remapping
	// requires one out of them.
